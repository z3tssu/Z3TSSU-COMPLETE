## Step-by-Step Method:

1. **Preview the Chapter by Skimming:**
    - Flip through the chapter quickly without reading — just notice headings, images, graphs, length, and structure.
    - Get a sense of the overall content and layout.
2. **Read the End-of-Chapter Questions First:**
    - Look at any quizzes or review questions at the end of the chapter.
    - This helps you understand what the author considers important.
    - Reading these questions first sets your focus on what to look for while reading.
3. **Read Bolded Text, Headings, and Subheadings:**
    - Go back to the beginning and read only the bolded text (titles, subtitles).
    - Bold text highlights key concepts the author wants you to remember.
    - Start building a mental map of how the information is organized.
4. **Read the First and Last Sentences of Each Paragraph:**
    - Skim through the chapter, reading just the first and last sentences of each paragraph.
    - These sentences usually introduce and summarize the main idea.
    - This first exposure is not for full comprehension but to familiarize your brain with the content’s structure.
5. **Now Read the Chapter Fully with Notes:**
    - With this mental framework, your brain is now prepared.
    - When you read the full chapter in detail, comprehension and retention improve dramatically.
    - Take notes as you read to reinforce learning.
