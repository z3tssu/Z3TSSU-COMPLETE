This is a senior leadership challenge in a high-impact ministry. Your main goal will be to ensure all digital and systems support functions are robust, resilient, and responsive to the security and emergency needs of Seychelles’ citizens[1](https://www.mia.gov.sc/)[2](https://mia.gov.sc/about/departments/seychelles-police-force)[3](https://mia.gov.sc/about/departments/immigration-and-civil-status-department)[7](https://mia.gov.sc/about/departments/sfrsa)[8](https://mia.gov.sc/about/departments/disaster-risk-management-division)[9](https://www.crimario.eu/seychelles-opens-two-maritime-information-sharing-centres/)[10](https://mia.gov.sc/about/departments/seychelles-prison-services).
