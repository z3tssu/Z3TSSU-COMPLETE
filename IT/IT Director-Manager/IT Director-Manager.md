## IT Management Skills

1. Theoretical. This is all about gaining a broader understanding of  
    leadership: leading with purpose, creating a vision, aligning teams,  
    etc. For that, I recommend reading Simon Sinek’s books and following him on YouTube. He’s got some really solid content: [https://youtube.com/simonsinek](https://youtube.com/simonsinek)
2. Practical – This is more focused on day-to-day leadership:  
    building trust, motivating people, and so on. Sam Levin does a great job covering these topics. Check out his channel here: [https://youtube.com/samlevin-grow](https://youtube.com/samlevin-grow)

## ISO 21001 Toolkit
