    Conduct a team meeting to introduce yourself, share your leadership style and vision, and open the floor for introductions and concerns. Start building trust by showing you value their work and input.
    
- **Identify IT Focal Points in Each Entity:**
    
    Each portfolio likely has an IT contact or technician. Identify and establish a direct line of communication with these individuals. They will provide valuable on-ground insights and help coordinate support efforts.
    

### Category: Technical Environment Assessment

- **Collect Hardware and Software Inventories:**
    
    Request or initiate a complete inventory of servers, workstations, network devices, and software licenses. Validate the data accuracy and identify outdated, unsupported, or undocumented systems.
    
- **Review Network Infrastructure per Agency:**
    
    Collect and analyze network diagrams for each department. Identify single points of failure, lack of redundancy, or insecure configurations.
    
- **Document Critical Applications and Systems:**
    
    For each portfolio, identify applications crucial for daily operations (e.g., case management for police, visa systems for immigration). Assess reliability, maintenance schedules, and support structures.
    
- **Review Uptime and Downtime Logs:**
    
    Examine logs or reports documenting system uptime, downtime incidents, causes, and resolutions. If such reports don’t exist, initiate a system to track this moving forward.
    
- **Review SOPs for System Support:**
    
    Obtain and evaluate any available standard operating procedures related to maintenance, support, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery. Identify gaps or areas needing updates.
    

### Category: Cybersecurity Readiness Assessment

- **Evaluate Antivirus/EDR Implementation:**
    
    Determine whether antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are deployed on all critical systems. Check for centralized management and alert handling procedures.
    
- **Assess Patch Management Practices:**
    
    Investigate how operating system and software patches are applied. Look for automation tools in use, current patch levels, and areas prone to lagging behind in updates.
    
- **Review User Access Controls:**
    
    Audit account management processes. Check for shared accounts, use of administrative privileges, orphaned accounts, and password policies.
    
- **Check Backup and Recovery Procedures:**
    
    Confirm what data is backed up, where it's stored, how often, and when the last successful restoration test was conducted. Verify if offsite or cloud backups exist.

### PHASE 3: Days 31–60 – Stabilize, Standardize, and Close Gaps

### Category: Addressing Operational Risks

- **Resolve Critical Vulnerabilities or Failures:**
    
    Based on earlier assessments, begin resolving high-impact vulnerabilities or systemic failures. Prioritize actions that mitigate risk to national security, citizen data, and operational uptime.
    
- **Implement Centralized Event Logging:**
    
    Ensure logging is active across servers, security devices, and critical workstations. Begin designing a central log management system (e.g., SIEM) if none exists.
    
- **Secure Internet-Exposed Assets:**
    
    Perform a vulnerability scan or manual assessment of any externally accessible systems. Patch, firewall, or segment services that are publicly accessible.
    
- **Draft Interim Disaster Recovery Protocols:**
    
    If formal disaster recovery plans are absent, create temporary SOPs that clarify what to do if systems fail. Focus first on mission-critical systems (Police, Immigration databases, etc.).
    

### Category: Building Governance and Structure

- **Define Roles and Responsibilities within the Team:**
    
    Clarify roles within your team to avoid overlaps and accountability gaps. Assign leads for helpdesk, infrastructure, cybersecurity, documentation, and training.
    
- **Introduce or Formalize a Ticketing System:**
    
    If none exists, introduce a lightweight ticketing system (even spreadsheets or Google Forms can work). Track issues, assign ownership, set deadlines, and create accountability.
    
- **Write or Update IT Policies:**
    
    Begin drafting policies governing:
    
    - Acceptable Use of Government IT Resources
    - System Backup & Recovery
    - Change Management for IT Systems
    - Incident Response Protocols
- **Conduct IT Gap Analysis vs Best Practices:**
    
    Compare the current IT environment against ISO/IEC 27001 controls or basic CIS benchmarks. Document risks, priority areas, and regulatory misalignments.
