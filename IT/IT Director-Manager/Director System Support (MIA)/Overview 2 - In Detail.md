## 1. Preparation Before Your First Day

- **Gather Existing Documentation:**
    - Request and review all current policies, IT systems overviews, organizational charts, support tickets, incident logs, and ongoing project records for every portfolio (police, immigration, prisons, fire & rescue, disaster management, maritime security, etc.).
    - Compile key contacts for every department and major IT/service vendors.
- **Clarify Your Mandate:**
    - Obtain your detailed job description and performance expectations from HR or your appointing authority.
    - Confirm lines of reporting, accountability, and escalation procedures.

## 2. Initial Onboarding (Days 1-10)

## Meet Key Stakeholders

- **Schedule Individual Meetings:**
    - With permanent secretaries, department heads of each agency, and your IT/system team.
    - Listen for current pain points, major projects, and historic system issues.
- **Introduce Yourself to Staff:**
    - Hold a team meeting with all support/IT personnel; set expectations of open, respectful, and collaborative culture.

## Physical and Logical Access

- Ensure you have:
    - Access badges and required security clearance.
    - User credentials for system dashboards, service desks, email, file shares, application portals, and incident response tools.
    - A working workspace with required hardware/software.

## 3. Build a Comprehensive Support Landscape Map

## Systems Audit & Asset Mapping

- **Request a List of All Systems and Infrastructure:**
    - For each portfolio, collect detailed inventories of servers, client devices, specialized systems (dispatch, surveillance, border control, etc.), and software assets.
- **Document Network Topology:**
    - Obtain network diagrams, identify points of integration, bottlenecks, and redundancy.

## Review Current Support Processes

- Examine and document:
    - Service/help desk operations and ticket workflows.
    - Incident response playbooks.
    - Hardware/software procurement processes.
    - Data backup policies and disaster recovery plans.

## 4. Conduct Risk, Security, and Continuity Assessments

- **Review Cybersecurity Posture:**
    - Ensure up-to-date antivirus, firewalls, and patch management.
    - Identify vulnerabilities—run/commission penetration tests where possible.
    - Confirm procedures for managing privileged access, password rotation, and security incident reporting.
- **Assess Business Continuity Measures:**
    - Validate backup schedules, data redundancy, and operational continuity for critical systems (e.g., police, border entry, emergency comms).
- **Check Compliance:**
    - Compare processes against national ICT, security, and data handling standards[1](https://www.ega.go.tz/uploads/standards/sw-1574918368-level1%20big.pdf)[2](https://www.ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2024-09/MICDE%20-%20Guidelines%20on%20Management%20of%20ICT%20Resources%20in%20MDACs%20%5B2024%5D.pdf)[3](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_ict-functional-guidance.pdf).

## 5. Engage with Each Department in Detail (Weeks 2–4)

- **Departmental IT Operations Reviews:**
    - Hold workshops with each major agency’s operations and IT staff.
    - Map out:
        - All mission-critical workflows reliant on IT.
        - Key support pain points, recent outages, or ongoing issues.
        - Unique security/compliance needs.
- **Report Findings:**
    - Prepare a “Current State” briefing (risk register, asset inventory, support gaps) to present to your supervisor and other stakeholders.

## 6. Establish Short-Term Actions (“Quick Wins”)

- **Immediate Issue Resolution:**
    - Triage and direct urgent fixes for critical system outages, major vulnerabilities, or ongoing performance problems—especially anything that jeopardizes public safety or national security.
- **Streamline Support Processes:**
    - Clarify priority ticket procedures for critical systems.
- **Communications:**
    - Launch regular status updates for department heads and your team to report on resolved and new issues.

## 7. Design and Launch System Support Strategy

## Standard Operating Procedures

- Develop or update SOPs for:
    - Service desk operations (ticket intake, triage, escalation).
    - Change and release management (who signs off on system changes?).
    - Hardware/software lifecycle management.

## Policy and Documentation

- Update and standardize policies on:
    - Acceptable use, asset management, cybersecurity, data privacy, and incident response.
- Draft or refine user support manuals and FAQ resources[4](https://jobo.sc/jobs/director-11/)[1](https://www.ega.go.tz/uploads/standards/sw-1574918368-level1%20big.pdf)[2](https://www.ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2024-09/MICDE%20-%20Guidelines%20on%20Management%20of%20ICT%20Resources%20in%20MDACs%20%5B2024%5D.pdf).

## Training & Capacity Building

- Assess skills gaps in your IT/support staff.
- Schedule hands-on training and mentorship for new technologies and best practices.
- Develop documentation and lead short workshops for end-users on system basics and security hygiene.

## 8. Stakeholder Engagement & Organizational Integration

- **ICT Steering Committee:**
    - Participate in or establish an ICT oversight committee for cross-agency alignment, funding, and prioritization[2](https://www.ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2024-09/MICDE%20-%20Guidelines%20on%20Management%20of%20ICT%20Resources%20in%20MDACs%20%5B2024%5D.pdf).
- **Inter-Agency Cooperation:**
    - Facilitate periodic joint sessions between IT leads from all portfolios to coordinate solutions, share knowledge, and synchronize upgrades.

## 9. Continuous Performance Monitoring

- **Metrics and KPIs:**
    - Set up dashboards and reports for key metrics:
        - Ticket resolution times, system downtime, security breaches, staff satisfaction, backup test success rates.
- **Regular Reviews:**
    - Conduct monthly team and stakeholder reviews to adjust priorities and report on progress and lessons learned[5](https://www.psb.gov.sc/sites/default/files/documents/Govt%20Functions%20Manual%20Approved%20June%202019.pdf)[4](https://jobo.sc/jobs/director-11/).

## 10. Strategic and Long-Term Planning

- **Develop a Multi-Year IT Roadmap:**
    - Plan for phased upgrades, consolidation, cloud migration, and advanced security measures.
- **Align with National Strategies:**
    - Ensure all plans align with national digital policy, e-office plans, and agency-specific modernization goals[1](https://www.ega.go.tz/uploads/standards/sw-1574918368-level1%20big.pdf)[2](https://www.ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2024-09/MICDE%20-%20Guidelines%20on%20Management%20of%20ICT%20Resources%20in%20MDACs%20%5B2024%5D.pdf).

## 11. Reporting and Accountability

    - Send monthly, quarterly, and annual reports to senior management on IT projects, issues, progress, and risks.
    - Include analysis of budget, staffing, system health, and compliance.

## 12. Crisis and Incident Management

- **Prepare for Emergencies:**
    - Confirm rapid response protocols for outages, cyberattacks, or system failures.
    - Assign roles, maintain up-to-date contact lists, and regularly run incident simulations.

## 13. Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement

- Schedule regular feedback loops with end-users (department staff) and your IT team to gather suggestions and improve processes.
- Continuously monitor technology trends, relevant national standards, and peer ministry best practices to keep support modern and resilient.
