# Exporting Nessus Scans

Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, such as [EyeWitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), which can be used to take screenshots of all web applications identified by Nessus and greatly assist us with working through the results and finding more value in them.

## Nessus Report Formats

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="PDF Report" %}
**PDF Report**

* Provides results in a **formatted, shareable** manner.
* Allows selection between an **Executive Summary** or a **Custom Report**.
* Includes details such as:
  * Hosts scanned.
  * Number of vulnerabilities per host.
  * Severity, **CVSS score**, plugin number, and issue name.
  * **Direct links** to Tenable’s plugin database for more information.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="HTML Report" %}
**HTML Report**

* Also supports the **Executive Summary** and **Custom Report** formats.
* Provides an interactive way to view findings **without requiring a PDF reader**.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

> Note: These scan reports should only be shared as either an appendix or supplementary data to a custom penetration test/vulnerability assessment report. They should not be given to a client as the final deliverable for any assessment type.

## Exporting Nessus Scans

It looks like you're summarizing the **export options for Nessus scans** and the ability to automate report downloads. Here’s a more structured explanation:

Nessus provides <mark style="color:green;">two main export formats</mark> for saving scan data:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Nessus File (.nessus)" %}
**Nessus File (.nessus)**

* This is an **XML-based file**.
* Includes:
  * **Scan settings** (configuration used for the scan).
  * **Plugin outputs** (details of vulnerabilities and findings).
* Useful for **importing** scans back into Nessus or **sharing raw scan data** with other security tools.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Nessus DB File (.db)" %}
**Nessus DB File (.db)**

* A more **comprehensive** export format.
* Contains:
  * The `.nessus` XML file.
  * The **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Stores scan state information.
  * The **Plugin Audit Trail**: Tracks plugin execution details.
  * Any **scan attachments** (if applicable).
* Useful for **forensic analysis** and **detailed audit tracking** of scan activities.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Automating Scan Report Downloads**

Nessus allows automation of report downloads via the **Nessus REST API**. A useful tool for this is:

[**Nessus-Report-Downloader**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb)

* A **CLI-based script** that automates the **retrieval of Nessus scan reports**.
* Supports downloading **all available formats**.
* Useful for:
  * **Integrating Nessus scan results** with other security tools.
  * **Batch exporting scans** for reporting or compliance purposes.

```bash
z3tssu@htb[/htb]$ ./nessus_downloader.rb
