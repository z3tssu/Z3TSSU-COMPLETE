# Nessus Plugins

Nessus works with plugins written in the [Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_Attack_Scripting_Language) and can target new vulnerabilities and CVEs. These plugins contain information such as the vulnerability name, impact, remediation, and a way to test for the presence of a particular issue.

A searchable database of all published plugins is on the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/plugins).
