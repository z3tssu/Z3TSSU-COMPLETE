Creating a professional and clear report is one of the most critical parts of an assessment. While automated tools can help identify vulnerabilities, the **human factor** is essential in organizing, validating, and presenting the findings in a way that is actionable and understandable to **both technical and non-technical audiences**.

## **Key Sections of a Strong Report**

A comprehensive vulnerability assessment report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**
    
2. **Overview of Assessment**
    
3. **Scope and Duration**
    
4. **Vulnerabilities and Recommendations**
    

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

- Provides a **high-level overview** for non-technical stakeholders such as executives or managers.
    
- Focus on **critical and high-severity findings**, remediation priorities, and the overall security posture.
    
- Include **visual summaries**, such as a graph or chart, to quickly illustrate the number of vulnerabilities by severity:
    

Example:

|Severity|Count|
|---|---|
|**Critical**|5|
|**High**|8|
|**Medium**|12|
|**Low**|20|

---

### **2. Overview of Assessment**

- Explain the **methodology** followed during the assessment.
    
- Include:
    
    - Tools used (e.g., **Nessus**, **Burp Suite**, **Nmap**, custom scripts).
        
    - Testing approaches (black-box, white-box, or gray-box).
        
    - Any compliance frameworks followed (e.g., **OWASP**, **NIST**, **PCI DSS**).
        
- Provide details on the **testing timeline** and processes used to verify results.
    

---

### **3. Scope and Duration**

- Define **exactly what was in scope** for the assessment, such as:
    
    - IP ranges
        
    - Domains and subdomains
        
    - Cloud environments
        
    - Applications or APIs
        
- Mention **out-of-scope systems**, if any.
    
- Include **testing dates** and **duration** for clear documentation.

### **4. Vulnerabilities and Recommendations**

Each vulnerability should be presented in a **clear, consistent format** that allows both technical teams and executives to understand the risk and the remediation path.

#### **Recommended Template**

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|**Vulnerability Name**|Descriptive name of the finding.|
|**CVE**|Associated CVE identifier (if available).|
|**CVSS Score**|Severity rating, preferably using **CVSS v3.1**.|
|**Description**|Explain what the issue is, in non-technical and technical terms.|
|**Proof of Concept**|Evidence of the vulnerability (e.g., screenshots, logs, or command outputs).|
|**Affected Systems**|List impacted hosts, applications, or components.|
|**Remediation Steps**|Clear, actionable instructions to fix or mitigate the issue.|
|**References**|Include links to official advisories, documentation, or best-practice guidelines.|

---

### **5. Closing**

- Keep the **tone professional and concise**.
    
- Ensure that **technical explanations are clear** and supported by references.
    
- Proofread for **grammar, clarity, and accuracy**.
    
- Always validate that findings are **manually tested** to eliminate false positives.
    

A **well-structured, easy-to-read report** adds credibility to the assessment and makes it easier for the client to take action on your recommendations.
