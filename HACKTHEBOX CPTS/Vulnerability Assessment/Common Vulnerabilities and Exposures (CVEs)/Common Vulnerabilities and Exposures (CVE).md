[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a **public catalog of security issues** maintained with support from the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**.

- Each vulnerability is assigned a **unique CVE ID** by a **CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)**.
    
- The purpose of the CVE ID is to **standardize references** for vulnerabilities and exposures.
    
- A CVE record contains **descriptions, references, and other details** to help organizations understand potential risks and their impact.
    

**Requirements for a CVE assignment:**

- Must be **independently fixable**
    
- Must affect **one codebase**
    
- Must be **acknowledged and documented by the vendor**

## **Stages of Obtaining a CVE**

**Stage 1: Identify if CVE is Required and Relevant**

- Confirm the issue is a vulnerability per CVE criteria:
    
    - Exploitable
        
    - Negative impact to **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**
        
    - Requires a **code or specification change** to fix
        
- Verify no existing CVE ID already exists for the issue.
    

---

**Stage 2: Contact the Affected Vendor**

- Make a good faith effort to report the issue directly to the vendor.
    
- Refer to [CVE Disclosure Practices](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#appendix#a) for guidelines.
    

---

**Stage 3: Determine if Request Goes to Vendor CNA or Third-Party CNA**

- If the vendor is a CNA, request a CVE directly through them.
    
- Check the [list of CNAs](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html).
    
- If the vendor is **not a CNA**, reach out to a third-party coordinator.
    

---

**Stage 4: Submit a CVE Request via Web Form**

- Use the [CVE Web Form](https://cveform.mitre.org/) if other methods are unavailable.
    

---

**Stage 5: Confirmation of CVE Request**

- Upon submission, you receive a confirmation email.
    
- The CVE team may request additional details if needed.
    

---

**Stage 6: CVE ID Assignment**

- Upon approval, a **CVE ID** is issued.
    
- At this stage, the ID is **not public** yet.
    

---

**Stage 7: Public Disclosure Preparation**

- CVE IDs are disclosed once **all parties are notified** to prevent duplication and ensure awareness.
    

---

**Stage 8: CVE Announcement**

- When announced, ensure **each CVE ID** is clearly tied to a **distinct vulnerability**.
    

---

**Stage 9: Submit Final Information for Listing**

- Provide detailed information to the CVE Team for inclusion in the official database.
    
- The [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) also maintains this data.
    

---

## **Responsible Disclosure**

- Allows vendors to **fix vulnerabilities before public disclosure**, reducing the risk of malicious exploitation.
    
- Failure to responsibly disclose could result in **zero-day (0-day)** vulnerabilities being abused by attackers.

## **Examples**

### **CVE-2020-5902**

- **Type:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
    
- **Affected:** BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI)
    
- **Impact:** Complete system takeover (execute code, edit files, control services) if TMUI is accessible from the management port.
    

---

### **CVE-2021-34527** _(PrintNightmare)_

- **Type:** Remote Code Execution
    
- **Affected:** Windows Print Spooler Service
    
- **Impact:** Authenticated users can gain **full system control** (including domain controllers and workstations) by exploiting improper handling of file operation privileges.
