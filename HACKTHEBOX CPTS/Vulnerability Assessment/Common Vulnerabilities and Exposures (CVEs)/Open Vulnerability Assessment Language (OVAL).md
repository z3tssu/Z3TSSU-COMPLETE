# **Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)**

[OVAL](https://oval.mitre.org/) is an **international, publicly available standard** for evaluating and detailing the **state of a system** and its **security issues**.

- Co-supported by the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**.
    
- Provides a **standardized language** for encoding system attributes.
    
- Offers a **repository with 7,000+ definitions** for public use.
    
- Integrated with **NIST’s Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)** to support:
    
    - Automated vulnerability management
        
    - Measurement and compliance assessment
        
    - Policy enforcement

## **OVAL Process**

![Security policy compliance flowchart: Desired security settings and new information in XML are assessed for policy compliance. If compliant, the system is policy compliant. If not, implement changes using remediation strategies.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/graphics/VulnerabilityAssessment_Diagram_05.png)

The OVAL assessment process follows **three main steps**:

1. **Identify** system configurations for testing
    
2. **Evaluate** the current state of the system
    
3. **Report** results for further action
    

Reported states can include:

- **Vulnerable**
    
- **Non-compliant**
    
- **Installed Asset**
    
- **Patched**

## **OVAL Definitions**

- Definitions are written in **XML**.
    
- Identify software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, system information, and installed software **without exploitation**.
    
- Useful for determining **patching and remediation priorities** across a network.
    

### **Four Main Classes of OVAL Definitions**

- **OVAL Vulnerability Definitions** – Identify system vulnerabilities
    
- **OVAL Compliance Definitions** – Check if system configurations meet policy requirements
    
- **OVAL Inventory Definitions** – Detect if specific software is present
    
- **OVAL Patch Definitions** – Identify if required patches are installed

## **OVAL ID Format**

Each OVAL entry uses a unique identifier:

```
oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value
```

- **ID Types** include:
    
    - `def` – Definition
        
    - `obj` – Object
        
    - `ste` – State
        
    - `var` – Variable
        

**Example:**

```
oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116
```

## **Integration with Tools**

- Many scanners (e.g., **Nessus**) can **leverage OVAL definitions** to configure **security compliance scanning templates** efficiently.
