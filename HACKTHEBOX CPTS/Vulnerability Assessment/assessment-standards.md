# **Assessment Standards**

Both **penetration tests** and **vulnerability assessments** must follow recognized standards to be **legally accepted and accredited**. These standards ensure consistency, thoroughness, and efficiency in the testing process.

---

## **Compliance Standards**

Organizations must follow specific **security and compliance frameworks** to maintain certifications and conduct business. Key frameworks include:

### **1. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

- Applies to organizations **storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data** (e.g., banks, e-commerce).
    
- Requires:
    
    - Internal and external scanning of assets.
        
    - Proper **segmentation** of the **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)** from general networks.
        
    - Strong access controls and monitoring.
        
- Goal: Protect cardholder data and ensure secure handling of payment information.

### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

- Protects **patient data** in healthcare environments.
    
- Does **not** mandate vulnerability scanning.
    
- Requires **risk assessments** and **vulnerability identification** for accreditation.
    

---

### **3. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)**

- U.S. federal standard to safeguard **government systems and operations**.
    
- Requires:
    
    - Proof and documentation of a **vulnerability management program**.
        
    - Maintenance of **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of systems.
        

---

### **4. ISO 27001**

- **Global standard** for managing information security.
    
- Requires:
    
    - **Quarterly internal and external scans**.
        
    - Maintaining an effective **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.
        
- Used for international compliance and structured risk management.
    

---

> **Note:** Compliance supports security, but vulnerability management programs should be based on the **specific risk profile** and **environmental needs** of the organization, not just compliance checklists.

---

## **Penetration Testing Standards**

Penetration testing should always:

- Have a **clearly defined scope**.
    
- Be governed by a **signed legal agreement**.
    
- Avoid unnecessary system changes or disruptions (e.g., avoid changing passwords, limit exfiltration to screenshots or evidence).
    

### **Common Pentesting Frameworks**

#### **1. PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**

[PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) phases:

- Pre-engagement Interactions
    
- Intelligence Gathering
    
- Threat Modeling
    
- Vulnerability Analysis
    
- Exploitation
    
- Post-Exploitation
    
- Reporting
    

---

#### **2. OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**

[OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) covers five channels:

1. **Human Security** – Social engineering risks.
    
2. **Physical Security** – Physical access controls.
    
3. **Wireless Communications** – WiFi, Bluetooth, and similar.
    
4. **Telecommunications** – Voice/data transmission channels.
    
5. **Data Networks** – Internal/external network security.

#### **3. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**

[NIST Penetration Testing Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) phases:

- Planning
    
- Discovery
    
- Attack
    
- Reporting
    

---

#### **4. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)**

[OWASP](https://owasp.org/) provides frameworks and testing guides for application security:

- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
    
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
    
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)

Would you like me to generate a **table comparison** for these standards?
