## Purpose & Scope

- Identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses in assets.
    
- Little to no manual exploitation; provide remediation steps.
    
- Two common asks:
    
    - **Validate as many vulns as possible** with minimal, non-invasive checks to rule out false positives.
        
    - **Report all scanner findings** as-is.
        
- **Clarify scope and intent before starting.**
    
- **Test substantial patches before rollout** to avoid disruption.
    

## Methodology (8 Steps)

1. Conduct risk identification & analysis
    
2. Develop scanning policies
    
3. Identify scan types
    
4. Configure the scan
    
5. Perform the scan
    
6. Evaluate risks
    
7. Interpret results
    
8. Create a remediation plan
    

## Key Terms

### Vulnerability

- Weakness/bug in apps, networks, infrastructure.
    
- Registered in **CVE**; severity via **CVSS** (metrics include attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, and confidentiality/integrity/availability impact).
    
- Example: SQL injection; higher CVSS if remotely exploitable without auth.
    

### Threat

- Process/event that increases the chance of adverse impact (e.g., actor exploiting a vuln). Likelihood rises with ease + reward.
    

### Exploit

- Code/resources used to take advantage of a weakness (often found on public platforms).
    

### Risk

- Possibility of assets/data being harmed or destroyed.
    
- Relationship:
    
    - **Risk:** something bad _could_ happen
        
    - **Threat:** something bad _is_ happening
        
    - **Vulnerabilities:** weaknesses that _could lead_ to a threat
        
- Risk level = **likelihood × impact** (qualitative matrix).
    

## Asset Management

### Asset Inventory (why)

- Know what you’re protecting to apply proper defenses and controls.
    
- Include classification to align security and access controls.
    

### What to Inventory

- **On-prem data**: endpoint/server disks, external drives, optical/flash media (legacy media as applicable).
    
- **Cloud provider data**: all storage/services across AWS/GCP/Azure (single or multi-cloud).
    
- **SaaS data**: e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft 365, iCloud, etc.
    
- **Applications**: locally deployed and cloud/SaaS apps used by the business.
    
- **Networking devices**: routers, firewalls, hubs/switches, IDS/IPS, DLP, etc.
    

### Keep It Current

- **Update the data asset inventory whenever assets are added/removed.**
