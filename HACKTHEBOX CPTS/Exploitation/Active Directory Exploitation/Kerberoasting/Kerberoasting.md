# Overview

- Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in Active Directory environments
- All you need to perform a Kerberoasting attack is
    1. account's cleartext password (or NTLM hash),
    2. a shell in the context of a domain user account, or SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host.
