- **Common**: Apps/printers store LDAP creds in web admin (weak/default pws).
- **Attack**:
    - View cleartext in console.
    - Or: Change LDAP IP to attacker; test conn → creds to nc on 389 (often cleartext).
- **Privs**: Often privileged; else → foothold.
- **Adv**: May need full LDAP server (see [post](https://medium.com/r3d-buck3t/pwning-printers-with-ldap-pass-back-attack-a0d8fa495210)).
