### üß† Concept of Attacks

- MSSQL `xp_dirtree` is not a vulnerability itself but abuses SMB authentication.
- Accessing a network share triggers automatic NTLMv2 hash transmission.
- The NTLMv2 hash can be:
    - **Replayed** (SMB Relay attack) to gain access to systems where the account has local admin privileges.
    - **Cracked** to reveal the plaintext password.
- SMB Relay cannot be used to attack the originating host due to Microsoft patching, but lateral movement is possible.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Initiation of the Attack via `xp_dirtree`

|Step|Description|Category|
|---|---|---|
|1|User input specifies function & network share folder|Source|
|2|Folder contents are listed/displayed|Process|
|3|Execution requires elevated MSSQL privileges|Privileges|
|4|SMB service receives forwarded request|Destination|

---

### üïµÔ∏è Stealing the Hash

|Step|Description|Category|
|---|---|---|
|5|SMB receives request initiated by MSSQL|Source|
|6|Folder is queried for contents|Process|
|7|MSSQL user's NTLMv2 hash is used for authentication|Privileges|
|8|Host we control receives authentication query|Destination|

### üîì Tools to Capture NTLMv2 Hashes

- **Responder**
- **Wireshark**
- **TCPDump**

---

### üêç Other MSSQL Command Execution Techniques

- MSSQL can potentially run Python code via SQL queries.
- More methods to be explored in future modules.
