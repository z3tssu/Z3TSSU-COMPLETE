**BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)** with headings and conceptual steps:

---

### üõë CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep) ‚Äì Overview

- **Critical RDP vulnerability** discovered in 2019
- Affects **TCP port 3389** (RDP service)
- Enables **unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
- Leverages a **Use-After-Free (UAF)** memory flaw
- Exploited via **manipulated connection initialization requests**
- **No login credentials required**
- Exploits memory management in the Windows **kernel**
- Runs payloads with **LocalSystem privileges**

### üß† Conceptual Attack Flow

**Initial Exploitation**

|Step|Description|Category|
|---|---|---|
|1|Malicious RDP settings initialization request|Source|
|2|Triggers vulnerable function (virtual channel creation)|Process|
|3|Runs under LocalSystem Account due to RDP service privileges|Privileges|
|4|Execution is redirected to kernel memory|Destination|

**Triggering Remote Code Execution**

|Step|Description|Category|
|---|---|---|
|5|Attacker injects payload to exploit freed kernel memory|Source|
|6|Kernel process handles freed memory and executes attacker's code|Process|
|7|Code runs with LocalSystem (kernel-level) privileges|Privileges|
|8|Reverse shell or command is sent back to attacker's system|Destination|

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BlueKeep Key Points

- No authentication required ‚Üí **unauthenticated attack vector**
- Kernel memory ‚Üí **highest privilege execution**
- Widely exploitable if systems are unpatched
- Used in **ransomware and malware attacks**
- Microsoft issued **patches** for even unsupported systems
- As of May 2019, ~950,000 systems were vulnerable
- ~25% of those still vulnerable today
