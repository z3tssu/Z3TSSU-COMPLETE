Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, both PowerView and BloodHound can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, and the authentication flow. After importing PowerView, we can use the[ Get-DomainTrust](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainTrust/) function to enumerate what trusts exist, if any.
