We can use the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet to enumerate domain trust relationships. This is especially helpful if we are limited to just using built-in tools.

```bash
PS C:\htb> Import-Module activedirectory

The above output shows that our current domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL has two domain trusts. The first is with LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL, and the IntraForest property shows that this is a child domain, and we are currently positioned in the root domain of the forest. The second trust is with the domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL, and the ForestTransitive property is set to True, which means that this is a forest trust or external trust. We can see that both trusts are set up to be bidirectional, meaning that users can authenticate back and forth across both trusts. This is important to note down during an assessment. If we cannot authenticate across a trust, we cannot perform any enumeration or attacks across the trust.
