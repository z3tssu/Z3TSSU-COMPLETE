```

**Sample Output**:

## **Creating HTML Reports from XML Output**

Using the XML output, we can generate **HTML reports** that are clear and user-friendly â€” ideal for documentation or sharing results with non-technical stakeholders.

### **Convert XML to HTML**

```bash
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

Open the `target.html` file in a browser to see a structured and detailed presentation of the results.

Would you like me to **add a quick explanation of when to use each output format** for different scenarios, such as scripting or reporting?
