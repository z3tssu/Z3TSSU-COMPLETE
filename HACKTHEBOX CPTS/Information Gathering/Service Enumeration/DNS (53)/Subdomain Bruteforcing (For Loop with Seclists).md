The individual `A` records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt).

An option would be to execute a `for-loop` in Bash that lists these entries and sends the corresponding query to the desired DNS server.

**Subdomain Brute Forcing**

```bash
z3tssu@htb[/htb]$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done

ns.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN A 10.129.34.136

mail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN A 10.129.18.201

app.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN A 10.129.18.15
```
