# Nmap Telnet

Footprinting the Service

The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.

```bash
z3tssu@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25

However, we can also use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests. If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running.
