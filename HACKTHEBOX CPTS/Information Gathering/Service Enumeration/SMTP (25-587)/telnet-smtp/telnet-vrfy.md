# Telnet - VRFY

The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).
