# Default Configuration

Both IMAP and POP3 have a large number of configuration options, making it difficult to deep dive into each component in more detail. If you wish to examine these protocol configurations deeper, we recommend creating a VM locally and install the two packages `dovecot-imapd`, and `dovecot-pop3d` using `apt` and play around with the configurations and experiment.

In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual [core settings](https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/) and [service configuration](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/) options that can be utilized for our experiments. However, let us look at the list of commands and see how we can directly interact and communicate with IMAP and POP3 using the command line.
