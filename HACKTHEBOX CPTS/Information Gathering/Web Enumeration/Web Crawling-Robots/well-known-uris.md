# .Well-Known URIs

## <mark style="color:red;">.Well-Known URIs</mark>

The `.well-known` standard, defined in [RFC 8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615), serves as a standardized directory within a website's root domain. This designated location, typically accessible via the `/.well-known/` path on a web server, centralizes a website's critical metadata, including configuration files and information related to its services, protocols, and security mechanisms.

By establishing a consistent location for such data, `.well-known` simplifies the discovery and access process for various stakeholders, including web browsers, applications, and security tools. This streamlined approach enables clients to automatically locate and retrieve specific configuration files by constructing the appropriate URL. For instance, to access a website's security policy, a client would request `https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt`.

The `Internet Assigned Numbers Authority` (`IANA`) maintains a [registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml) of `.well-known` URIs, each serving a specific purpose defined by various specifications and standards. Below is a table highlighting a few notable examples:

| URI Suffix                     | Description                                                                                           | Status      | Reference                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `security.txt`                 | Contains contact information for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.                      | Permanent   | RFC 9116                                                                                |
| `/.well-known/change-password` | Provides a standard URL for directing users to a password change page.                                | Provisional | https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-change-password-url/#the-change-password-well-known-uri |
| `openid-configuration`         | Defines configuration details for OpenID Connect, an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. | Permanent   | http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1\_0.html                              |
| `assetlinks.json`              | Used for verifying ownership of digital assets (e.g., apps) associated with a domain.                 | Permanent   | https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/specification.md     |
| `mta-sts.txt`                  | Specifies the policy for SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) to enhance email security.      | Permanent   | RFC 8461                                                                                |
