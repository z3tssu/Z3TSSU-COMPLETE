## **1. Downloading with `wget`**

Use this to download a file and save it to `/tmp`:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh
```

- `-O /tmp/LinEnum.sh` → Saves the file as `LinEnum.sh` in `/tmp`.

## **2. Downloading with `curl`**

Use `curl` to do the same thing:

```bash
curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
```

- `-o /tmp/LinEnum.sh` → Specifies the output file path and name.

## **3. Check if the Tools Are Installed**

Run:

```bash
which wget
which curl
```

If nothing is returned, install them:

```bash
sudo apt install wget curl
```

---

## **Tips**

- Use `-q` (quiet) with `wget` or `curl` to suppress output.
    
- Combine with pipes for **fileless execution**:
    

```bash
curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash
```
