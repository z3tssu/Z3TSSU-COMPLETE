## **1. How SCP Works**

- All data is **encrypted** during transfer.
    
- Requires **SSH login** (password or key-based).
    
- Works directly from the **terminal** on Linux, macOS, or Windows (with tools like PowerShell or Git Bash).

## **2. Downloading Files (Target → Attacker)**

If you have SSH access to the **target machine** and want to download a file to your **attacker machine**:

```bash
scp user@target_ip:/path/to/file /local/destination
```

**Example:**

```bash
scp john@192.168.1.50:/home/john/secret.txt ~/Downloads/
```

This copies `secret.txt` from `/home/john/` on the target to your `~/Downloads/` folder locally.

---

## **3. Uploading Files (Attacker → Target)**

To upload a file from your **attacker machine** to the **target machine**:

```bash
scp /local/file user@target_ip:/remote/path
```

**Example:**

```bash
scp evil_script.sh john@192.168.1.50:/home/john/
```

This places `evil_script.sh` in `/home/john/` on the target machine.

---

## **4. Authentication**

- You will be prompted for the SSH password unless:
    
    - An `ssh-agent` session is active.
        
    - You’re using an SSH private key (like `.pem` or `id_rsa`).

## **5. Useful Options**

### **A. Transfer Entire Directories**

```bash
scp -r user@target:/path/to/dir /local/destination
```

Example:

```bash
scp -r john@192.168.1.50:/var/logs ./logs_backup
```

---

### **B. Use a Non-Standard SSH Port**

If SSH is running on port `2222`:

```bash
scp -P 2222 user@target:/file ./localfile
```

---

### **C. Enable Compression (for Faster Transfers)**

For large files or slow networks:

```bash
scp -C bigfile.zip user@target:/tmp/
```
