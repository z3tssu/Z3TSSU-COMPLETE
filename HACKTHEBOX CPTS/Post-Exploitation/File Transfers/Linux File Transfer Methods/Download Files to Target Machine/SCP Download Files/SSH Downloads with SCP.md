## **1. Enable SSH on the Attacker Machine**

If you want to **receive files** on your attacker machine (like Pwnbox), make sure SSH is running.

### Enable SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Start SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### Check if SSH is Listening:

```bash
netstat -lnpt
```

You should see:

```
tcp   0   0 0.0.0.0:22   0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN
```

This confirms SSH is ready on port **22**.

## **2. Download a File from Target to Attacker**

On the **attacker machine**, run:

```bash
scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt .
```

**Breakdown**:

- `scp` → Runs secure copy.
    
- `plaintext@192.168.49.128` → Username and IP of the target.
    
- `/root/myroot.txt` → Full path of the file on the target.
    
- `.` → Save it in the **current directory** on the attacker.
    

Result: The file is securely copied to your attacker machine.

## **3. Upload a File to the Target**

To send a file from the **attacker** to the **target**:

```bash
scp myscript.sh user@192.168.49.128:/tmp/
```

This uploads `myscript.sh` to `/tmp/` on the target machine.

## **4. Pro Tips**

- Use a **temporary user** for transfers instead of `root` for better security.
    
- Add `-P <port>` if SSH is running on a non-standard port:
    

```bash
scp -P 2222 file.txt user@192.168.49.128:/tmp/
```

- Use `-C` to enable compression for large file transfers:
    

```bash
scp -C largefile.zip user@192.168.49.128:/tmp/
```
