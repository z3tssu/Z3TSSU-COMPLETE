If the network allows **outbound SSH (port 22)** connections, you can use **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)** to securely upload files between systems.

## **1. Upload a File (Attacker → Target)**

On your **attacker machine (Pwnbox)**:

```bash
scp /etc/passwd htb-student@10.129.86.90:/home/htb-student/
```

---

### **What Happens Next**

- You’ll be asked for the SSH user password:
    

```
htb-student@10.129.86.90's password:
```

- Once authenticated, the file will be copied to the target machine’s `/home/htb-student/` directory.
    

---

## **2. Requirements**

This will only work if:

- The target allows **outbound SSH (TCP/22)** traffic.
    
- The target IP is running an **SSH server** and is reachable.
    
- You have **valid SSH credentials** for the account.

## **3. Tips**

- Use `-P <port>` if SSH is running on a non-standard port:
    

```bash
scp -P 2222 /etc/passwd user@10.129.86.90:/home/user/
```

- Add `-v` for verbose mode if troubleshooting connection issues.
    
- For larger uploads, use compression:
    

```bash
scp -C bigfile.zip user@10.129.86.90:/tmp/
```
