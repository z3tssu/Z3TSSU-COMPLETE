- This method lets you **transfer files without using the network**.  
- It’s great for red team operations or when you only have **terminal access**.  
- You convert a file to Base64, copy the text, then decode it on the other machine.

## 1. Check File Integrity (Before and After Transfer)

On **Linux (attacker or source machine)**:

```bash
md5sum id_rsa
```

Example output:

```
4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```

This is the file’s **hash fingerprint** — you’ll use it to confirm the file didn’t change.

## 2. Encode File to Base64 on Linux

Run:

```bash
cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0; echo
```

**Important:**  
Use `-w 0` so the Base64 string is a single line with **no line breaks**.

Copy the entire Base64 string output.

---

## 3. Decode Base64 in PowerShell (Target Machine)

On the **Windows target** machine, paste the Base64 string into:

```powershell
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("PASTE-YOUR-BASE64-HERE"))
```

This recreates the file exactly as it was on the source machine.

---

## 4. Verify File Integrity (After Transfer)

On **Windows (target)**:

```powershell
Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5
```

Check that the hash matches the one you generated earlier.

## 5. Notes and Limitations

- `cmd.exe` limits strings to **8191 characters**.
    
- Some web shells may fail with very long strings.
    
- For **large files**, use other transfer tools like `certutil`, `bitsadmin`, or encrypted HTTP/S transfers.

## Best Use Cases

- SSH keys
    
- Small scripts
    
- Lightweight DLLs
