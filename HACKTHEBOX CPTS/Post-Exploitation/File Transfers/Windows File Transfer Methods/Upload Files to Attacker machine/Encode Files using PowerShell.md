This method is perfect when **network transfers are restricted**.  
You encode the file as Base64, copy the text manually (via clipboard, SSH, or text files), and decode it on another machine.

---

## **1. Encode the File (Target Machine)**

Use PowerShell to convert the file to Base64:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Encoding Byte))
```

This outputs a long Base64 string.  
Copy and paste the entire string safely â€” for example, into a text file or your terminal.

---

## **2. Generate an MD5 Hash (Target Machine)**

Create a hash of the original file so you can verify integrity after decoding:

```powershell
Get-FileHash "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Algorithm MD5 | Select Hash
```

Example output:

```
Hash
----
3688374325B992DEF12793500307566D
```

---

## **3. Decode the File (Attacker Machine or Linux Host)**

On your Linux box, paste the Base64 string and decode it:

```bash
echo "<base64-string>" | base64 -d > hosts
```

Replace `<base64-string>` with the Base64 data you copied.

---

## **4. Verify Integrity (Attacker Machine)**

Check the decoded file with:

```bash
md5sum hosts
```

Example output:

```
3688374325b992def12793500307566d  hosts
```

If the hash matches, the file was successfully transferred.

---

## **Tips**

- Best for **small files** like keys, scripts, or configs.
    
- For larger files, consider chunking the Base64 string or using another transfer method.
    
- Always verify the hash to ensure no corruption during copy-paste.
