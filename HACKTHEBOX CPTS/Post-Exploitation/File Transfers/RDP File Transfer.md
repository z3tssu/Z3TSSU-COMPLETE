**RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** is widely used for remote access in Windows environments. It also supports **efficient file transfers** between attacker and target systems, regardless of whether you are connecting from **Windows, Linux, or mixed environments**.

---

## 1. Copy & Paste (Windows-to-Windows)

**On Attacker (Windows client):**

- Right-click and **copy** the file you want to transfer.
    

**On Target (RDP session):**

- Paste the file directly into the desktop or desired folder.
    

**Notes:**

- Works only between Windows clients.
    
- May fail for **large files** or in mixed OS environments due to clipboard or session restrictions.

## 2. Mount a Local Folder on Linux Clients

When the **attacker** is on Linux, you can **mount a local folder** as a shared network drive in the RDP session.

---

### A. Using `rdesktop`

**On Attacker (Linux):**

```bash
rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

**Explanation:**

- `-r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'` → Shares `/home/user/rdesktop/files` as a **virtual disk** named `linux`.
    

**On Target (RDP session):**  
Navigate to:

```
\\tsclient\linux
```

---

### B. Using `xfreerdp`

**On Attacker (Linux):**

```bash
xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

**Explanation:**

- `/drive:linux,/path/to/local/folder` → Maps the local Linux folder as a network drive named `linux`.
    

**On Target (RDP session):**  
Access it via:

```
\\tsclient\linux
```

## 3. Windows RDP Client (`mstsc.exe`)

If the **attacker** is using Windows' built-in RDP client:

### Steps:

1. Open `mstsc.exe`.
    
2. Click **Show Options**.
    
3. Go to the **Local Resources** tab.
    
4. Under **Local Devices and Resources**, click **More...**.
    
5. Check the drives you want to share (e.g., `C:`, `D:`, or USB devices).
    

**On Target (RDP session):**  
Navigate to:

```
This PC > Redirected drives
```

---

## Notes & Tips

- Ensure **clipboard and drive redirection** are enabled in Group Policy and RDP settings if transfers fail.
    
- For large files, consider **compressed archives** before transferring.
    
- Log all transfers when handling **sensitive or regulated data** for auditing and reporting.
