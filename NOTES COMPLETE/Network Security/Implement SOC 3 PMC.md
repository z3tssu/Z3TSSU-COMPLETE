**Prerequisites:**
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. A dedicated server or virtual machine for Security Onion.
2. A separate server or VM for Wazuh standalone.
3. A server for Splunk.
4. A server for Snort (if you're not using Security Onion's built-in Snort).
5. Administrative access to all servers.
6. Understanding of basic Linux commands and networking concepts.

**1. Installation Steps:**

**Security Onion:**

Security Onion simplifies the installation process by providing an ISO image. Here's how to set it up:

1. Download the Security Onion ISO from the official website: https://securityonion.net/download
2. Create a bootable USB drive or mount the ISO on a virtual machine.
3. Follow the installation wizard, providing network configuration details when prompted.
4. Choose a dedicated interface for monitoring (e.g., eth1) and set a static IP address (e.g., 10.136.69.10).

**Wazuh Standalone:**

1. Install a clean Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or CentOS 7/8.
2. Download and run the Wazuh installation script from https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html#installing-wazuh-manager.
3. Follow the installation prompts, including setting up the Wazuh API.
4. Configure the Wazuh agent on each endpoint you want to monitor and connect them to the manager.

**Splunk:**

1. Download the Splunk Enterprise tarball from https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html.
2. Install and configure Splunk following their official documentation: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/InstallonLinux.
3. Set up forwarders to send logs from Security Onion, Wazuh, and other sources to your Splunk server.

**Snort:**

If you want to use Snort separately from Security Onion:

1. Install a clean Ubuntu or CentOS server.
2. Install Snort by following the official documentation: https://www.snort.org/documents/snort-3-1-0-0-0
3. Configure Snort rules and interfaces to monitor network traffic.

**2. Connecting and Linking the Tools:**

Now, let's connect and link these tools together:

**Security Onion:**

- Connect Security Onion to an available port on the distribution switch. Configure this interface with a static IP (e.g., 10.136.69.10) and make sure it's on the same subnet as your router and proxy server.

**Wazuh:**

- Install and configure the Wazuh agent on Security Onion to monitor its logs.
- Configure the Wazuh manager to forward alerts to Splunk for centralized monitoring.

**Splunk:**

- Set up data inputs to collect logs from Security Onion, Wazuh, and any other relevant sources.
- Create custom dashboards and alerts for security monitoring.

**Snort:**

- If using Snort separately, connect it to the network and configure it to monitor traffic. Ensure it sends alerts to a designated system (e.g., Security Onion or Splunk) for analysis.

**3. Network Cable Connections:**

Here's a simplified example of how to physically connect your network components:

1. **ISP Router:** Connect to the ISP's internet connection.
2. **Security Onion:** Connect to an available port on the distribution switch (e.g., port 3).
3. **Proxy Server:** Connect to another port on the distribution switch (e.g., port 4).
4. **Endpoints:** Connect your organization's devices (workstations, servers, etc.) to the distribution switch.
5. **Wazuh Agents:** Install Wazuh agents on your endpoints to monitor them.
6. **Splunk/Snort:** These can be on separate servers, connected to the same switch, or different switches, depending on your architecture.

Remember to configure the appropriate routing and firewall rules to allow traffic flow between these components.

Ensure that all servers and devices have proper IP addresses, DNS settings, and routing information to communicate effectively.

This is a high-level overview, and the exact implementation details may vary based on your network setup, security policies, and specific requirements. Always refer to the official documentation of the tools for the most up-to-date instructions. Additionally, consider consulting with a network security expert or specialist if you have complex security requirements.
