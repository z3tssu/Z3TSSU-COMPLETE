# Network Security
- ## Core Concepts: Authentication and Authorization
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or devices accessing the network.
- **Authorization**: Determining what actions or resources a user or device is allowed to access.
- ## Base Network Security Control Levels:
  1. **Physical Security Controls**
	- Prevent unauthorized physical access to network devices and components.
	  
	  2. **Technical Data Security Controls**
	- Prevent unauthorized access to network data using encryption and security layers.
	  
	  3. **Administrative Security Controls**
	- Establish policies, access levels, and authentication processes to ensure consistent security operations.
- ## Main Approaches of Network Security:
  1. **Access Control**
	- Ensures authentication and authorization through controls like firewalls, NAC, IAM, VPNs, etc.
	  
	  2. **Threat Control**
	- Detects and prevents anomalous/malicious activities on the network through tools like IDS/IPS, DLP, Endpoint Protection, etc.
- ## Key Elements of Access Control:
- **Firewall Protection**: Controls incoming/outgoing network traffic with security rules.
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Verifies device compliance before granting network access.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Manages user access to data systems and resources.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes tasks among resources to improve data processing flow.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolates access levels and groups assets to enhance protection.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**: Provides encrypted communication for secure remote access.
- **Zero Trust Model**: Minimizes access to the necessary level, emphasizing verification over trust.
- ## Key Elements of Threat Control:
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)**: Identifies and responds to network anomalies/threats.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Blocks the extraction of sensitive data.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Multi-layered protection for all connected endpoints.
- **Cloud Security**: Protects cloud-based systems with measures like VPN and data encryption.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Analyzes data for threat detection and incident management.
- **Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)**: Automates tasks for incident response and security operations.
- **Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response**: Identifies anomalies and threats in network traffic.
- ## Network Security Management Operations:
- **Deployment**: Installing devices and software, initial configuration, security policy implementation.
- **Configuration**: Feature and network access configuration, NAT and VPN implementation.
- **Management**: Automation, threat mitigation, user activity monitoring.
- **Monitoring**: System and threat monitoring, log and traffic capture.
- **Maintenance**: Upgrades, security updates, rule adjustments, license management, configuration updates.
- ## Managed Security Services (MSS):
- Outsourced services provided by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs).
- Services include Network Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Assessment, Incident Response, Behavioral Analysis, etc.
