- ### Essential Threat Intel Standards and Frameworks
	- Standards and frameworks provide structures to rationalise the distribution and use of threat intel across industries. They also allow for common terminology, which helps in collaboration and communication. Here, we briefly look at some essential standards and frameworks commonly used.

- [[1.6.3 ATT&CK Framework|MITRE ATT&CK]]:
  - Knowledge base of adversary behavior and tactics.
  - Helps security analysts investigate and track adversarial behavior.
  - Provides indicators and tactics for comprehensive analysis.

- **TAXII**:
  - Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII).
  - Defines protocols for secure threat intel exchange.
  - Enables near real-time threat detection, prevention, and mitigation.
  - Supports collection and channel sharing models.

- **STIX**:
  - Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX).
  - Language for standardized cyber threat information.
  - Defines relationships between threat elements.
  - Includes observables, indicators, TTPs, attack campaigns, etc.

- [[1.3.1 Intro|Cyber Kill Chain]]:
  - Breaks down adversary actions into steps.
  - Aids in investigating and understanding attack stages.
  - Includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command & control, and actions on objectives.

- [[1.5.1 Intro|Diamond Model]]:
  - Analyzes intrusion and tracks attack groups over time.
  - Four key areas: adversary, victim, infrastructure, and capabilities.
  - Identifies motives behind attacks and affected entities.
  - Explores the tools, systems, and TTPs used by adversaries.

Note: These standards and frameworks provide structures, common terminology, and methodologies for rationalizing the distribution and use of threat intelligence across industries. They enhance collaboration, communication, and the ability to analyze and
