Notes: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) - Definitions, Categories, and Classifications

1. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Definition:
   - CTI is evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice.
   - Purpose: Protect critical assets, inform cybersecurity teams, and guide business decisions.

2. Data, Information, and Intelligence Distinction:
   - Data: Discrete indicators associated with adversaries (e.g., IP addresses, URLs, hashes).
   - Information: Combination of multiple data points providing insights (e.g., frequency of employee access to a website).
   - Intelligence: Correlation of data and information to extract patterns through contextual analysis.

3. Goal of CTI:
   - Understand the relationship between operational environment and adversaries.
   - Defend the environment against attacks.
   - Develop cyber threat context.

4. [[Key Questions for Threat Intelligence]]:
   - Who's attacking?
   - What are their motivations?
   - What are their capabilities?
   - What indicators of compromise (IOCs) should be monitored?

5. Sources of Threat Intelligence:
   - Internal:
     - Corporate security events (vulnerability assessments, incident response reports).
     - Cyber awareness training reports.
     - System logs and events.
   - Community:
     - Open web forums.
     - Dark web communities for cybercriminals.
   - External:
     - Threat intelligence feeds (commercial & open-source).
     - Online marketplaces.
     - Public sources (government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments).

6. Threat Intelligence Classifications:
   - Strategic Intel: High-level intel mapping risk areas based on trends and emerging threats impacting business decisions.
   - Technical Intel: Evidence and artefacts of attacks used by adversaries, helping develop defense mechanisms.
   - Tactical Intel: Assessment of adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), strengthening security controls.
   - Operational Intel: Insights into adversaries' motives and intent, understanding critical assets that may be targeted.
