- Threat Intel Transformation Process
	- Threat intel is obtained from a data-churning process that transforms raw data into contextualised and action-oriented insights geared towards triaging security incidents. 
	- The transformational process follows a six-phase cycle:

- **Direction**:
  - Define objectives and goals of the threat intel program.
  - Identify information assets and business processes requiring defense.
  - Determine potential impact of asset loss or process interruptions.
  - Identify sources of data and intel for protection.
  - Determine required tools and resources for asset defense.
  - Enable security analysts to pose investigative questions.

- **Collection**:
  - Gather necessary data to address defined objectives.
  - Utilize commercial, private, and open-source resources.
  - Automate data collection to save time for incident triaging.

- **Processing**:
  - Extract, sort, and organize raw data.
  - Normalize different data formats.
  - Correlate data with appropriate tags.
  - Present data visually in a usable and understandable format.
  - Utilize SIEMs for efficient data parsing.

- **Analysis**:
  - Derive insights from aggregated information.
  - Uncover indicators and attack patterns.
  - Investigate potential threats.
  - Define action plans to avert attacks and defend infrastructure.
  - Strengthen security controls or justify resource investment.

- **Dissemination**:
  - Tailor intelligence for different stakeholders.
  - Provide concise reports for C-suite members, covering trends, financial implications, and strategic recommendations.
  - Share threat IOCs, adversary TTPs, and tactical action plans with technical teams.

- **Feedback**:
  - Regularly interact with stakeholders for feedback.
  - Improve the threat intelligence process.
  - Enhance implementation of security controls.
  - Maintain effective communication between teams.

Note: The six-phase cycle provides a structured approach to transform raw data into actionable threat intelligence, facilitating the triaging of security incidents and improving overall security posture.
