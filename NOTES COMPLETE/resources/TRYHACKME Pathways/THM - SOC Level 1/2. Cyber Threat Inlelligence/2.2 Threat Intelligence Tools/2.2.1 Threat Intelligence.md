Title: Introduction to Threat Intelligence

- #### Definition of Threat Intelligence:
  - Threat intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats.
  - It involves understanding the relationship between an organization's operational environment and adversaries targeting it.

- #### Mitigating Risks through Threat Intelligence:
  - Who's attacking you? Identify the threat actors targeting the organization.
  - What's their motivation? Understand the reasons behind their attacks.
  - What are their capabilities? Assess the adversaries' technical abilities and resources.
  - What indicators of compromise should you look out for? Identify the artifacts and evidence of an ongoing or potential attack.

- #### Threat Intelligence Classifications:
  1. Strategic Intelligence:
     - High-level intelligence focusing on the organization's threat landscape.
     - Maps out risk areas based on trends, patterns, and emerging threats.
     - Guides business decisions regarding risk management and resource allocation.

  2. Technical Intelligence:
     - Examines the evidence and artifacts left behind by adversaries.
     - Helps incident response teams create a baseline attack surface for analysis and defense development.
     - Informs technical security measures and vulnerability management.

  3. Tactical Intelligence:
     - Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
     - Enables real-time investigations and proactive security controls.
     - Enhances incident response capabilities and threat detection.

  4. Operational Intelligence:
     - Focuses on adversaries' motives and intent to conduct attacks.
     - Helps security teams understand critical assets (people, processes, technologies) that may be targeted.
     - Guides the development of targeted defense strategies and risk mitigation measures.
