## Introduction
The proprietary language used by Yara for rules may seem simple at first, but mastering it requires a deep understanding of the patterns you want to search for. In this guide, we will walk through the basic structure of a Yara rule and how to use it effectively.

## Yara Rule Structure
A Yara rule consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose. It is important to include these components for a valid and functional rule. The required components are:

1. **Rule File**: The file where the Yara rule is defined.
2. **Target**: The name of the file, directory, or process ID to apply the rule to.

## Creating a Basic Yara Rule
Let's create a simple Yara rule to illustrate the process. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file named "somefile" using the `touch` command:
   ```
   $ touch somefile
   ```

2. Create a new file named "myfirstrule.yar" with the following command:
   ```
   $ touch myfirstrule.yar
   ```

3. Open "myfirstrule.yar" in a text editor (e.g., nano) and enter the following snippet. Save the file afterwards:
   ```yar
   rule examplerule {
       condition: true
   }
   ```

## Testing the Rule
Let's test our newly created Yara rule on the "somefile" we previously created:

```
$ yara myfirstrule.yar somefile
```

If "somefile" exists, Yara will output "examplerule" because the condition has been met. Here's an example of the output:

```
examplerule somefile
```

However, if the file does not exist, Yara will display an error message similar to the following:

```
error scanning sometextfile: could not open file
```
