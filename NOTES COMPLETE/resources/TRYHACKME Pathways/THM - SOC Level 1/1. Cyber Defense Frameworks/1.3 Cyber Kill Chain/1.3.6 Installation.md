Notes:

1. Persistence Phase:
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker aims to maintain access to the compromised system by installing a persistent backdoor.

2. Need for Persistence:
   - Persistence ensures the attacker can regain access even if the connection is lost, initial access is removed, or the system is patched.

3. Techniques for Achieving Persistence:
   - Installing a web shell on the webserver: A malicious script used to maintain access, written in web development languages like ASP, PHP, or JSP.
   - Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine: Utilizing tools like Meterpreter from the Metasploit Framework to establish remote access.
   - Creating or modifying Windows services: Manipulating Windows services to execute malicious scripts or payloads regularly.
   - Adding entries to "run keys" in the Registry or Startup Folder: Executing the payload upon user login.
   - Timestomping: Modifying file timestamps to evade detection and make the malware appear legitimate.
