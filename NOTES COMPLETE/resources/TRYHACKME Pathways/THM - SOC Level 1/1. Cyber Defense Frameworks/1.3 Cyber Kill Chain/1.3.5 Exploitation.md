#### 1. Exploitation Phase:
   - In the Exploitation phase, "Megatron" aims to gain access to the system by exploiting vulnerabilities.

#### 2. Creative Exploitation Techniques:
   - "Megatron" created two phishing emails:
     - One contains a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page.
     - Another contains a macro attachment that executes ransomware upon opening.

#### 3. Actions in the Exploitation Phase:
   - After gaining access, the attacker can:
     - Exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities.
     - Escalate privileges or perform lateral movement through the network.
     - Lateral movement is the technique used to move deeper into a network for obtaining sensitive data.

#### 4. Zero-day Exploits:
   - "Megatron" may apply a "Zero-day Exploit":
     - Zero-day exploit/vulnerability refers to an unknown exploit that exposes a software or hardware vulnerability.
     - Difficult to detect initially, providing no opportunity for detection.

#### 5. Examples of Exploitation Techniques:
   - Victim triggers the exploit through email attachments or malicious links.
   - Utilizing zero-day exploits.
   - Exploiting software, hardware, or human vulnerabilities.
   - Triggering exploits for server-based vulnerabilities.
