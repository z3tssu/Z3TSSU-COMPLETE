1. Weaponization Phase:
   - After successful reconnaissance, the attacker ("Megatron") moves on to crafting a "weapon of destruction."
   - "Weaponizer" combines malware and exploit into a deliverable payload.
   - Automated tools or DarkWeb purchases are common for generating or obtaining malware.
   - Sophisticated actors or APT groups may develop custom malware to evade detection.

2. Terminology:
   - Malware: Program designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer.
   - Exploit: Program or code exploiting vulnerabilities or flaws in applications or systems.
   - Payload: Malicious code executed by the attacker on the target system.

3. "Megatron's" Approach:
   - "Megatron" chooses to buy an existing payload from the DarkWeb to save time.

4. Actions in the Weaponization Phase:
   - Creation of infected Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros or VBA scripts.
   - Creation of malicious payloads or sophisticated worms implanted on USB drives for distribution.
   - Selection of Command and Control (C2) techniques for executing commands on the victim's machine or delivering more payloads.
   - Choice of backdoor implant to bypass security mechanisms and gain access to the computer system.
