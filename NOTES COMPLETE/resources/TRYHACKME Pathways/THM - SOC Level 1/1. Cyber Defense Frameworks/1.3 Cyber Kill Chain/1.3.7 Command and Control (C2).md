Title: Command and Control (C2) Channels in Malware Communication

- Introduction:
  - After establishing persistence and executing malware, the attacker gains control over the victim's machine.
  - C2 (Command and Control) channels enable remote control and manipulation of the compromised host.
  - C2 communication is also referred to as C&C or C2 Beaconing.
- C2 Channel Types:
  1. Traditional C2 Channels:
     - IRC (Internet Relay Chat): Previously commonly used but easily detected by modern security solutions.
  2. Current C2 Channel Options:
     - HTTP (Port 80) and HTTPS (Port 443):
       - Blends malicious traffic with legitimate traffic, aiding evasion of firewalls.
     - DNS (Domain Name Server):
       - Infected machine makes constant DNS requests to an attacker's DNS server.
       - Also known as DNS Tunneling for C2 communication.
- Significance of C2 Infrastructure Ownership:
  - Adversary or another compromised host can control the C2 infrastructure.
- Importance of Recognizing and Monitoring C2 Channels in Security Operations.
