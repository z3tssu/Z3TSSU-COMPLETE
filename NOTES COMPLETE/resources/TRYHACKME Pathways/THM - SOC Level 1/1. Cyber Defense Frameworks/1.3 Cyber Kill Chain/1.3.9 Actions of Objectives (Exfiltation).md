Title: Attacker's Actions in the Final Phase of an Attack

- Introduction:
  - After completing the [[1.3.1 Intro|six phases]] of the attack, the attacker, "Megatron," proceeds to achieve their objectives.
  - With hands-on keyboard access, the attacker can carry out various actions to fulfill their goals.

Actions performed by the attacker in this phase:
1. Collecting user credentials:
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities or using social engineering techniques to obtain login credentials from users.
2. Privilege escalation:
   - Exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to elevate access privileges, such as gaining domain administrator access from a workstation.
3. Internal reconnaissance:
   - Interacting with internal software and systems to identify vulnerabilities and potential points of exploitation.
4. Lateral movement:
   - Moving through the company's environment, potentially compromising additional systems and accounts.
5. Data collection and exfiltration:
   - Gathering sensitive data from compromised systems and exfiltrating it to external locations.
6. Deleting backups and shadow copies:
   - Removing or tampering with backup copies and snapshots, including Microsoft's Shadow Copy technology.
7. Overwriting or corrupting data:
   - Intentionally modifying or damaging data to disrupt operations or compromise its integrity.

Importance of Recognizing and Responding to Actions in the Final Phase of an Attack:
- Timely detection and mitigation can prevent further damage and limit the impact of the attacker's actions.
- Proactive security measures and incident response planning are crucial for reducing the likelihood and impact of such attacks.
