1. Reconnaissance from Attacker's Perspective:
   - Reconnaissance involves discovering and collecting information about the system and the victim.
   - It is the planning phase for adversaries.

2. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) in Reconnaissance:
   - OSINT is a part of reconnaissance.
   - It is the first step for attackers to carry out further attack phases.
   - Attackers study the victim by collecting available information from publicly accessible resources.
   - Information collected includes company size, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
   - Determines the best target for the attack.

3. Attacker's Perspective: The Scenario:
   - Example scenario of a malicious attacker named "Megatron" planning a sophisticated attack.
   - Extensive research and preparation for the Cyber Kill Chain.
   - Starting with the Reconnaissance phase.

4. Email Harvesting:
   - Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addresses.
   - Used by attackers for phishing attacks to steal sensitive data.
   - Tools available for reconnaissance purposes:
     - [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester): Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from multiple public data sources.
     - [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/): Email hunting tool to obtain contact information associated with the domain.
     - [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/): Collection of OSINT tools based on various categories.

5. Social Media Usage:
   - Attackers utilize social media platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to gather information.
   - Information from social media aids in conducting phishing attacks.
