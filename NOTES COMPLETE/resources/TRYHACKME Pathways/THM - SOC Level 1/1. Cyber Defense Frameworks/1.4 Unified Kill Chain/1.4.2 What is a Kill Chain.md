  2. Exploitation: Attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities, such as web vulnerabilities.
  3. Privilege Escalation: Attacker gains higher-level access or elevated privileges.
- Importance of Detailed Explanation:
  - Further details about each stage of the Kill Chain will be provided later in the discussion.
  - Detailed understanding helps in developing comprehensive defensive strategies.
