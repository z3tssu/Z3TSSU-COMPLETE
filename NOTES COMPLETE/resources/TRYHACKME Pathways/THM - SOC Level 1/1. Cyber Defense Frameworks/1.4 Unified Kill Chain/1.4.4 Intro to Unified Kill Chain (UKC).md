Title: Overview of the Unified Kill Chain Framework

- Purpose of the Unified Kill Chain (UKC) Framework:
  - The UKC, published in 2017, aims to complement existing cybersecurity kill chain frameworks like Lockheed Martin's and MITRE's ATT&CK.
  - It provides a comprehensive methodology to understand and analyze the various phases of an attack.

- Phases of the UKC:
  - The UKC identifies 18 phases in an attack, ranging from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding the attacker's motive.
  - These phases have been grouped together in this room to focus on key areas for brevity.

- Benefits of the UKC:
  - Modern and Detailed: The UKC offers a more contemporary and detailed perspective compared to traditional kill chain frameworks.
  - Extensive Coverage: With its 18 phases, the UKC provides a more comprehensive view of the attack lifecycle.
  - Enhanced Understanding: The framework helps analysts and defenders gain deeper insights into attacker methodologies and motives.

- Distinction from Other Frameworks:
  - Complementary Approach: The UKC is designed to complement existing kill chain frameworks rather than compete with them.
  - Focus on Detail: While other frameworks may have a smaller number of phases, the UKC's strength lies in its extensive level of detail and granularity.

- Continuing Exploration:
  - In the remaining tasks, the UKC will be explored further, highlighting specific areas of focus within the framework.
