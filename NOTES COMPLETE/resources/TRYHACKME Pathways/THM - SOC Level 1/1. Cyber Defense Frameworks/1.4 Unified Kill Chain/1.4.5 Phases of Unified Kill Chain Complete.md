   - Examples of gathered information:
     - Systems and services running on the target.
     - Contact lists or employee lists for social engineering.
     - Potential credentials for later stages.
     - Network topology for pivoting.

2. Weaponization (MITRE Tactic TA0001)
   - Setting up necessary infrastructure for the attack.
   - Examples:
     - Establishing a command and control server.
     - Creating a system to catch reverse shells and deliver payloads.

3. Social Engineering (MITRE Tactic TA0001)
   - Manipulating employees to aid the attack.
   - Examples:
     - Getting users to open malicious attachments.
     - Impersonating web pages to obtain credentials.
     - Impersonating users or utility engineers for access.

4. Exploitation (MITRE Tactic TA0002)
   - Taking advantage of system weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
   - Examples:
     - Uploading and executing a reverse shell.
     - Interfering with automated scripts for code execution.
     - Abusing web application vulnerabilities for code execution.

5. Persistence (MITRE Tactic TA0003)
   - Techniques to maintain access to a system.
   - Examples:
     - Creating a service on the target system for reaccess.
     - Adding the system to a Command & Control server.
     - Leaving backdoors to execute actions upon certain events.

6. Defence Evasion (MITRE Tactic TA0005)
   - Techniques used to evade defensive measures.
   - Examples:
     - Web application firewalls.
     - Network firewalls.
     - Anti-virus systems.
     - Intrusion detection systems.
   - Provides valuable information for response and defense improvement.

7. Command & Control (MITRE Tactic TA0011)
   - Establishing communication between the adversary and target.
   - Actions possible:
     - Executing commands.
     - Stealing data and credentials.
     - Pivoting to other systems on the network.

8. Pivoting (MITRE Tactic TA0008)
   - Technique to reach inaccessible systems within a network.
   - Examples:
     - Using access to a public web server to attack internal systems.
     - Exploiting systems within the same network for valuable data.

9. Discovery (MITRE Tactic TA0007)
   - Uncovering information about the target system and network.
   - Building knowledge base from various sources:
     - Active user accounts and permissions.
     - Applications and software in use.
     - Web browser activity.
     - Files, directories, and network shares.
     - System configurations.

10. Privilege Escalation (MITRE Tactic TA0004)
    - Attempting to gain higher-level permissions within the system.
    - Leveraging vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    - Levels of elevated access sought:
      - SYSTEM/ROOT.
      - Local Administrator.
      - Admin-like access user account.
      - User account with specific access or functions.

11. Execution (MITRE Tactic TA0002)
    - Utilizing the attack infrastructure set up earlier.
    - Using the accessed system as a staging site and command operations tunnel.
    - Deploying malicious code, malware, and backdoors.
    - Creating remote trojans, C2 scripts, malicious links, and scheduled tasks.
    - Ensuring recurring presence and persistence.

12. Credential Access (MITRE Tactic TA0006)
    - Stealing account names and passwords.
    - Methods include keylogging and credential dumping.
    - Enhances stealth by using legitimate credentials.

13. Lateral Movement (MITRE Tactic TA0008)
    - Moving through the network and accessing other targeted systems.
    - Utilizing stolen credentials and elevated privileges.
    - Emphasizing stealthy techniques for better success.

14. Collection (MITRE Tactic TA0009)
    - Adversary seeks to gather valuable data of interest.
    - Compromises data confidentiality.
    - Target sources for data collection:
      - Drives.
      - Browsers.
      - Audio.
      - Video.
      - Email.

15. Exfiltration (MITRE Tactic TA0010)
    - Adversary aims to steal data from the compromised systems.
    - Data is packaged using encryption and compression.
    - C2 channel and tunnel utilized for exfiltration.

16. Impact (MITRE Tactic TA0040)
    - Adversary compromises data integrity and availability.
    - Manipulates, interrupts, or destroys assets.
    - Goals include disrupting business and operational processes.
    - Actions may involve removing account access, disk wipes, and data encryption (e.g., ransomware, defacement, DoS attacks).

- 17. Objectives:
	- Encrypting files and systems with ransomware for payment.
	- Reputation damage:
	- Releasing private and confidential information to the public.

These additional phases and objectives provide further insight into the adversary's actions and intentions during the attack lifecycle.
