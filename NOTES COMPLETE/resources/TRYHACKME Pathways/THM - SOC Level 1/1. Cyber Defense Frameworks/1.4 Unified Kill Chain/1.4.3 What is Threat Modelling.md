Title: Understanding Threat Modelling in Cybersecurity

- Purpose of Threat Modelling:
  - Threat modelling is a series of steps aimed at improving the security of a system.
- Key Steps in Threat Modelling:
  1. Identifying Systems and Applications:
     - Determine which systems and applications require security measures and their importance to normal operations.
     - Consider if sensitive information is involved, such as payment info or addresses.
  2. Assessing Vulnerabilities:
     - Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the identified systems and applications.
     - Analyze how these vulnerabilities could be exploited.
  3. Creating a Plan of Action:
     - Develop a comprehensive plan to address and mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
  4. Implementing Preventive Measures:
     - Establish policies and procedures to prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities in the future.
     - Examples include implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) or conducting phishing awareness training for employees.
- Role of Threat Modelling in Risk Reduction:
  - Threat modelling provides a high-level overview of an organization's IT assets and outlines procedures to address vulnerabilities.
  - It helps in reducing risk within systems and applications.
- Influence of the UKC Framework:
  - The UKC framework can encourage the practice of threat modelling.
  - It assists in identifying potential attack surfaces and understanding how systems may be exploited.
- Frameworks Used in Threat Modelling:
  - STRIDE, DREAD, and CVSS (among others) are specific frameworks commonly used in threat modelling.
  - Further exploration of these frameworks is available in the "Principles of Security" room on TryHackMe.
