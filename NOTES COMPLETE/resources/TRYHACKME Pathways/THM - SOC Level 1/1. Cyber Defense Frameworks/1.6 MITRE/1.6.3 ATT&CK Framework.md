### The ATT&CK® Framework

- Definition and Origin:
  - MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
  - In 2013, MITRE initiated the project to document common TTPs used by APT groups targeting enterprise Windows networks.
  - The project, known as FMX (Fort Meade Experiment), involved emulating adversarial TTPs and collecting data from network attacks.

- Growth and Expansion:
  - The ATT&CK® framework has evolved and expanded over time.
  - Originally focused on Windows platforms, it now covers other platforms like macOS and Linux.
  - Contributions to the framework come from various sources, including security researchers and threat intelligence reports.

- Relevance for Blue and Red Teamers:
  - The ATT&CK® framework is not limited to blue teamers (defenders) but also useful for red teamers (attackers).

- ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise:
  - Visit the [ATT&CK® website](https://attack.mitre.org/) for further exploration.
  - The ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise can be found at the bottom of the page.
  - The matrix consists of 14 categories displayed across the top.
  - Each category represents a tactic, and techniques used by adversaries to perform the respective tactic are listed.
  - The categories align with the seven-stage Cyber Attack Lifecycle (credit to Lockheed Martin for the Cyber Kill Chain).
