Notes: Using ATT&CK® Matrix for Threat Intelligence in the Aviation Sector

Scenario:
- Role: Security analyst in the aviation sector.
- Objective: Gather threat intelligence using the ATT&CK® Matrix for APT groups targeting the sector during the transition to cloud infrastructure.
- Focus: Identify techniques that target areas of concern and assess coverage gaps.

1. Threat Intelligence and ATT&CK®:
   - Threat Intelligence (TI) or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI): Information or TTPs attributed to adversaries.
   - Importance: Allows defenders to make informed decisions about defensive strategies.
   - ATT&CK® Matrix: Provides a comprehensive framework mapping adversary techniques.
   - Goal: Make threat intelligence actionable.

2. Threat Intelligence Collection:
   - In-house Teams: Large corporations may have dedicated teams gathering threat intelligence for internal use.
   - Sources:
     - Open Source: Publicly available threat intelligence.
     - Vendor Subscriptions: Access to specialized threat intelligence platforms like CrowdStrike.
   - Challenges: Defenders with multiple roles need to allocate time for threat intelligence amidst other tasks.

3. Scenario Execution:
   - Objective: Assess APT groups targeting the aviation sector during the cloud infrastructure transition.
   - Using ATT&CK® Matrix:
     - Identify APT Groups: Analyze APT groups known for targeting the aviation sector.
     - Review Information: Examine the selected group's tactics, techniques, and more.
     - Focus on Concern Areas: Identify techniques that specifically target areas of concern.
     - Coverage Evaluation: Determine if any coverage gaps exist in defending against these techniques.
