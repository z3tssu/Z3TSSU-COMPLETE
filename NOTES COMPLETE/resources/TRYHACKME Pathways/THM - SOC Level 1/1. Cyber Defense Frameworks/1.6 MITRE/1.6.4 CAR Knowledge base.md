### Cyber Analytics Repository

- Definition of CAR:
  - The [MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)](https://car.mitre.org/) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK® adversary model.
  - CAR provides a data model used in pseudocode representations and includes analytics implementations targeted at specific tools.
  - It focuses on validated and well-explained analytics, emphasizing their operating theory and rationale.

- CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access:
  - This CAR analytic is identified as CAR-2020-09-001 and addresses the topic of scheduled task file access.
  - The page provides a brief description of the analytic and references to ATT&CK in terms of technique, sub-technique, and tactic.

- To take full advantage of CAR, we can view the [Full Analytic List or the CAR ATT&CK®](https://car.mitre.org/analytics/) [Navigator layer](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/#layerURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-attack/car/master/docs/coverage/car_analytic_coverage_04_05_2022.json) to view all the analytics.
Title: CAR Analytics - Pseudocode and Implementation Examples

- Pseudocode and Splunk Query:
  - CAR provides pseudocode representations of its analytics, which are human-readable instructions or algorithms describing the behavior of a program or system.
  - The CAR-2020-09-001 analytic page includes pseudocode and a Splunk query example for searching this specific analytic within Splunk.
  - The pseudocode helps understand the logic and steps involved in the analytic's implementation.

- Reference to Sysmon:
  - The CAR-2020-09-001 page mentions Sysmon, a system monitoring tool. Further details about Sysmon can be explored in the Sysmon room.

- #### Full Analytic List:
  - The [Full Analytic](https://car.mitre.org/analytics) List view in CAR provides an overview of available analytics, their implementations, and the targeted OS platform.
  - It allows users to quickly identify which analytics are applicable to their environment.

- #### CAR ATT&CK® Navigator:
  - The [CAR ATT&CK® Navigator layer](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/#layerURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-attack/car/master/docs/coverage/car_analytic_coverage_04_05_2022.json) showcases the analytics aligned with the ATT&CK® framework.
  - Analytics highlighted in purple on the navigator correspond to the analytics currently available in CAR.

- Another Analytic Example: CAR-2014-11-004: Remote PowerShell Sessions:
  - CAR-2014-11-004 is another analytic provided by CAR.
  - The analytic page includes pseudocode and an EQL version of the pseudocode.
  - EQL (Event Query Language) can be used to query, parse, and organize Sysmon event data, providing a different implementation option.

- CAR as a Resource:
  - CAR extends beyond the Mitigation and Detection summaries in the ATT&CK® framework, providing additional analytics and implementations.
  - It is a valuable resource for finding analytics that can complement the ATT&CK® framework.
  - CAR is not a replacement for ATT&CK® but an additional tool to enhance threat detection and analysis capabilities.
