[MITRE ENGAGE](https://engage.mitre.org/) - Adversary Engagement Approach

- Definition of MITRE Engage:
  - MITRE Engage is a framework that enables planning and conducting adversary engagement operations to achieve cybersecurity goals.
  - It focuses on leveraging Cyber Denial and Cyber Deception to disrupt adversaries' operations and mislead them.

- MITRE Engage: Objective Evaluations for Cybersecurity Solutions
	-   Goal: Assist organizations in making informed decisions about cybersecurity solutions
	-   Approach: Conduct objective evaluations of product capabilities and performance
	-   Focus: Emphasizes assessment of cybersecurity products, not the stages of a cyber attack

- Adversary Engagement Approach:
  - MITRE Engage is considered an Adversary Engagement Approach, which involves proactive interaction with adversaries.
  - Cyber Denial: This approach aims to prevent adversaries from conducting their operations effectively.
  - Cyber Deception: It involves intentionally planting artifacts to mislead and confuse adversaries.

- Starter Kit:
  - The Engage website provides a [starter kit](https://engage.mitre.org/starter-kit/) to help users get started with the Adversary Engagement Approach.
  - The starter kit includes whitepapers, checklists, methodologies, and processes that offer guidance and resources for initiating adversary engagement activities.

- Engage Matrix:
  - Similar to MITRE ATT&CK, Engage has its own [matrix](https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/), known as the Engage Matrix.
  - The Engage Matrix provides a visual representation of the different components and elements related to adversary engagement.
  - It serves as a framework to guide planning, discussions, and decision-making during adversary engagement operations.

### Categories of MITRE ENGAGE Matrix

Based on the information provided on the Engage website, here are the categories of the MITRE ENGAGE Matrix:

1. Prepare:
   - Description: Prepare the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome.
   - Objective: Plan and strategize operational activities to achieve specific goals in adversary engagement.

2. Expose:
   - Description: Expose adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities.
   - Objective: Detect and identify adversaries by observing their actions and responses to deception measures.

3. Affect:
   - Description: Affect adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations.
   - Objective: Disrupt and impede adversaries' ability to conduct successful operations through targeted actions.

4. Elicit:
   - Description: Elicit information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs).
   - Objective: Gain insights into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures by actively monitoring and studying their behavior.

5. Understand:
   - Description: Understand the outcomes of the operational actions.
   - Objective: Analyze and comprehend the results and impact of the operational activities conducted during adversary engagement.

Additional Resources:
- [Engage Handbook](https://engage.mitre.org/matrix): Refer to the Engage Handbook for further information and guidance on implementing the MITRE ENGAGE framework.
- [Engage Matrix Explorer](https://engage.mitre.org/matrix): Interact with the Engage Matrix Explorer tool, which allows filtering by information from MITRE ATT&CK and exploring the different categories and relationships within the matrix.

Note: By default, the matrix focuses on the "Operate" category, which encompasses Expose, Affect, and Elicit activities in the adversary engagement process.
