Title: Key Terms in Cybersecurity

- #### APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):
  - Refers to a team/group (threat group) or nation-state group engaged in long-term attacks against organizations or countries.
  - APT groups do not necessarily rely solely on advanced tools but employ persistent tactics and techniques.
  - The term "advanced" can be misleading, as APT groups use common techniques rather than exclusive super-weapons.
  - FireEye maintains a list of current APT groups.

- #### TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):
  - Tactic: Represents the adversary's goal or objective in an attack.
  - Technique: Describes how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
  - Procedure: Refers to the execution process of the technique.
  - Understanding TTPs becomes clearer as you progress through each section of the framework and threat intelligence.
