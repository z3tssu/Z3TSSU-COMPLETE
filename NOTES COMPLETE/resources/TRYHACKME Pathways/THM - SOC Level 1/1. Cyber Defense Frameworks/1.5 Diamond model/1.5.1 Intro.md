Title: The Diamond Model

- The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis was developed in 2013 by cybersecurity professionals Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz.
  - It is composed of four core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim.
  - Additional components or axes of the Diamond Model are Social, Political, and Technology.
  - The four core features are edge-connected, forming a diamond shape.
- The Diamond Model captures the fundamental atomic elements of any intrusion activity.
  - It allows for flexibility and expansion to incorporate new ideas and concepts.
  - The model enables real-time integration of intelligence for network defense.
  - It automates correlation across events and classifies them into adversary campaigns.
  - The Diamond Model facilitates forecasting of adversary operations and planning mitigation strategies.
- Learning about the Diamond Model helps identify intrusion elements.
  - It aids in creating a Diamond Model for events like breaches, intrusions, attacks, or incidents.
  - The model assists in analyzing Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- It simplifies explaining events or valuable information about malicious threat actors to non-technical individuals.
