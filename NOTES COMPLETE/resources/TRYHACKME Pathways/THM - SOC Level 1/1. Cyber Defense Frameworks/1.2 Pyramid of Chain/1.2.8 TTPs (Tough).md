Notes:

1. Final Stage - Apex of the Pyramid of Pain:
   - Congratulations on reaching the final stage of the Pyramid of Pain.
   - This stage involves TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures) encompassing the entire [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/) ATT&CK Matrix.
   - TTPs represent the steps taken by adversaries to achieve their goals, starting from phishing attempts to persistence and data exfiltration.

2. Rapid Detection and Response to TTPs:
   - Quick detection and response to TTPs leave adversaries with little chance to fight back.
   - Example: Detecting and remediating a Pass-the-Hash attack using Windows Event Log Monitoring.
   - Benefits of swift action:
     - Rapid identification of compromised hosts.
     - Prevention of lateral movement within the network.

3. Attacker's Options:
   - When facing quick detection and response to TTPs, attackers have two choices:
     - Go back, conduct more research and training, and reconfigure their custom tools.
     - Give up and seek another target.
