Title: The Impact of Detection on Attackers and the Importance of Host Artifacts

- Introduction:
  - Acknowledgment of the impact of detection on attackers and their response.
  - Importance of host artifacts in identifying and tracing attacker activities.

- Implications of Detection:
  - Annoyance and Frustration for Attackers:
    - Explanation of how detection at this level frustrates attackers.
    - Need for attackers to revise attack tools and methodologies.
    - Increased time and resource investment required by the attacker.

- Host Artifacts:
  - Definition and Significance:
    - Definition of host artifacts as traces or observables left by attackers on a system.
    - Importance of host artifacts in detecting and analyzing attacks.

  - Examples of Host Artifacts:
    - Registry Values:
      - Explanation of how attackers may modify registry values.
      - Detection of suspicious or unauthorized changes.

    - Suspicious Process Execution:
      - Recognition of unusual or malicious processes running on a system.
      - Identification of process execution patterns indicating an attack.

    - Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
      - Definition of IOCs as signals indicating a compromised system.
      - Highlighting the role of IOCs in identifying ongoing attacks.

    - Files Dropped by Malicious Applications:
      - Identification of files created or dropped by malicious software.
      - Examination of file attributes, contents, or behavior for detection.

    - Other Exclusive Threat Traces:
      - Mentioning the diverse range of host artifacts.
      - Examples of additional artifacts attackers may leave behind.

- Importance of Host Artifacts in Threat Detection:
  - Detection and Attribution:
    - How host artifacts aid in identifying the presence and actions of attackers.
    - Contribution to the attribution of attacks to specific threat actors.

  - Incident Response and Forensics:
    - Utilization of host artifacts for incident response investigations.
    - Support for forensic analysis and understanding attack methods.

- Conclusion:
  - Recap of the impact of detection on attackers and their need to adapt.
  - Emphasis on the significance of host artifacts in attack detection.
  - Highlighting the role of host artifacts in identifying and analyzing ongoing threats.
  - Recognition of host artifacts' value for incident response and forensic investigations.
