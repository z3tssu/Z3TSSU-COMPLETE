Notes:

1. Network Artifacts in the Yellow Zone:
   - Belong to the yellow zone in the Pyramid of Pain.
   - Detection and response to these artifacts can increase the attacker's required time to adapt or modify their tactics and tools.
   - Provides more time to respond, detect upcoming threats, and remediate existing ones.

2. Examples of Network Artifacts:
   - User-Agent string:
     - Can be used by attackers.
     - A User-Agent string that is uncommon or unusual may indicate suspicious activity.
     - Defined by RFC2616 as a request-header field containing information about the user agent originating the request.

   - C2 Information:
     - Command-and-Control (C2) information.
     - Can be used to control compromised systems remotely.

   - URI patterns followed by HTTP POST requests:
     - Patterns in Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) followed by POST requests.
     - Suspicious patterns may indicate malicious activity.

3. Detection of Network Artifacts:
   - Wireshark PCAPs:
     - Packet data files containing network information.
     - Analyzed using network protocol analyzers like TShark.

   - IDS Logging:
     - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs, such as Snort.
     - IDS can provide information about suspicious network activity.

4. Suspicious HTTP POST requests:
   - Detection of suspicious strings within HTTP POST requests.
   - Indicates potentially malicious activity.
   - Monitoring and analysis of POST requests can help identify threats.

- 5. Filter out User-Agent Strings with Tshark
```bash
tshark --Y http.request -T fields -e http.host -e http.user_agent -r analysis_file.pcap
```
