Notes:

1. Challenging Part for Adversaries:
   - Congratulations on reaching the challenging stage for adversaries.
   - Detection capabilities against artifacts have been leveled up.
   - Attacker's options at this stage:
     - Give up trying to break into the network.
     - Go back and create a new tool with the same purpose.
     - Game over for attackers as they need to invest money in building a new tool or find an equivalent one.
     - May require training to become proficient in a certain tool.

2. Attacker's Utilized Tools:
   - Creation of malicious macro documents (maldocs) for spearphishing attempts.
   - Backdoor creation for establishing Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
   - Development of custom .EXE and .DLL files, payloads, or password crackers.

3. Suspicious Trojan Activity:
   - Presence of suspicious "Stealer.exe" dropped in the Temp folder.

4. Weapons for Defense:
   - Antivirus signatures, detection rules, and YARA rules:
     - Effective tools for defense against attackers at this stage.

   - ### Resources for Threat Hunting and Incident Response:
     - [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) and [Malshare](https://malshare.com/):
       - Provide access to samples, malicious feeds, and YARA results.
       - Valuable for threat hunting and incident response.

   - ### SOC Prime Threat Detection Marketplace:
     - [Platform](https://tdm.socprime.com/signup) where security professionals share detection rules.
     - Covers various threats, including the latest CVEs exploited by adversaries.

   - ### Fuzzy Hashing:
     - Strong defense against attacker's tools.
     - Enables similarity analysis of files with minor differences.
     - Example: Usage of [SSDeep](https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html).
     - SSDeep official website provides a complete explanation of fuzzy hashing.
