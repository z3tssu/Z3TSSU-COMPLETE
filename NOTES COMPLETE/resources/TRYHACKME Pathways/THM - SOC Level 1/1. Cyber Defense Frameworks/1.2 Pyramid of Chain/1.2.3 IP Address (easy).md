Title: IP Addresses as Indicators and Fast Flux Networks

- An IP address is used to identify devices connected to a network, including desktops, servers, and CCTV cameras.
- IP addresses are crucial for sending and receiving information over the network.
- In the Pyramid of Pain, IP addresses are indicated with the color green.
- Defense standpoint:
  - Knowledge of adversary IP addresses is valuable.

  - Adversaries can easily circumvent this tactic by using new public IP addresses.
- Malicious IP connections ([app.any.run](https://app.any.run))
- Fast Flux:
  - DNS technique used by botnets to hide malicious activities.
  - Compromised hosts act as proxies for phishing, web proxying, malware delivery, and communication.
  - Goal: Make malware's communication with command and control servers difficult to discover.
- Fast Flux network:
