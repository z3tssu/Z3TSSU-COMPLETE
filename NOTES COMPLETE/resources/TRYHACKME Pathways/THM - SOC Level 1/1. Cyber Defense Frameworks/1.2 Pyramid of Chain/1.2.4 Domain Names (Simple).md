Notes on "Domain Names":

- Domain Names:
  - Mapping IP address to text string
  - Can contain domain and top-level domain (e.g., evilcorp.com)
  - Can have sub-domain, domain, and top-level domain (e.g., tryhackme.evilcorp.com)
  - DNS (Domain Name System) details not covered here

- Challenges for attackers in changing domain names:
  - Need to purchase, register, and modify DNS records
  - Loose standards of DNS providers and APIs make it easier for attackers

- Punycode:
  - Converts non-ASCII words to Unicode ASCII encoding
  - Example: adÄ±das.de (Punycode: http://xn--addas-o4a.de/)

- Browser support for Punycode:
  - Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari can translate obfuscated characters into full Punycode

- Detection of malicious domains:
  - Proxy logs or web server logs can be used

- Attackers use URL shorteners to hide malicious domains:
  - URL shorteners create short, unique URLs that redirect to specified websites
  - Attackers use services like 
	  - bit.ly
	  - goo.gl
	  - ow.ly
	  - s.id
	  - smarturl.it
	  - tiny.pl
	  - tinyurl.com
	  - x.co

- Revealing the actual website behind a shortened link:
  - Append "+" to the shortened URL in the address bar
  - Examples of shortened links provided (non-existent)
