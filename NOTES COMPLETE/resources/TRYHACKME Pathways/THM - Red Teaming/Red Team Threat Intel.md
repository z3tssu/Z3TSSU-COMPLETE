1.  Red Team Threat Intelligence (RTTI) is information collected and analyzed by a red team to simulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world adversaries.
2.  RTTI includes information on the tools, methods, and infrastructure used by attackers.
3.  RTTI also includes information on the latest trends and threats in the cyber threat landscape.
4.  The goal of RTTI is to provide the red team with the information they need to create realistic and effective simulations of real-world attacks.
5.  RTTI helps the red team to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system that an actual attacker could exploit.
6.  RTTI is an important aspect of red team engagements as it helps the red team to understand the potential threats, and tailor their attack accordingly to simulate the real-world scenario.
