Countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide an alternative interpretation of critical information or indicators (deception), or deny the adversaryâ€™s collection system.
1.  The two examples from the previous task have solutions to mitigate their vulnerabilities. The first example is using the same public IP address for different activities like running Nmap, using the Metasploit framework, and hosting the phishing pages. The solution is to use a different IP address for each activity, in order to avoid the block of all activities if one is detected.

2.  The second example is an unsecured database used to store data received from a phishing page. It is considered a high-risk vulnerability because it can be easily targeted by malicious third parties. The solution is to ensure that the database is properly secured, so that the data can only be accessed by authorized personnel.
