3\. Vulnerability Analysis

This is not to be confused with vulnerabilities related to cybersecurity. An OPSEC vulnerability exists when an adversary can obtain critical information, analyses the findings, and act in a way that would affect your plans.

**<u>Example of Vulnerability Analysis:</u>**

The scenario described in the passage highlights two examples of how a lack of proper operational security (OPSEC) can lead to vulnerabilities for a red team during a simulated cyber-attack. The first example involves using the same IP address for different activities, such as discovering live hosts, sending phishing emails, and attempting to exploit software vulnerabilities, which can lead to the IP address being blocked and all activities being disrupted.

Another example involves storing sensitive data in an unsecured database, which can lead to the data being compromised and used against the client. Additionally, lax OPSEC can also result in less sophisticated vulnerabilities such as social media posts that reveal the client's name and tip off the blue team to the red team's tactics.
