1.  An agent is a program generated by the C2 framework that calls back to a listener on a C2 server.
2.  Most of the time, this agent enables special functionality compared to a standard reverse shell.
3.  Most C2 Frameworks implement pseudo commands to make the C2 Operator’s life easier.
4.  Some examples of this may be a pseudo command to Download or Upload a file onto the system.
5.  It’s important to know that agents can be highly configurable, with adjustments on the timing of how often C2 Agents beacon out to a Listener on a C2 Server and much more.
