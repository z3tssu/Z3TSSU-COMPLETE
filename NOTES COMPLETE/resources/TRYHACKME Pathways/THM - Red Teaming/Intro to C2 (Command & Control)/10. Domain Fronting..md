Domain fronting is a technique used to hide the true destination of internet traffic by disguising it as traffic to a different domain. This can be used to bypass censorship or access content that is blocked in a certain location. For example, a user in a country where a certain website is blocked could use domain fronting to access the website by making it appear as if they are visiting a different, unblocked website. It makes it difficult for governments or other entities to block the traffic because it looks like it is going to a different website.
