7.1 Staged Payloads

**<u>Staged Payloads</u>**

Staged payloads require a callback to the C2 server to download additional parts of the C2 agent. This is commonly referred to as a “Dropper” because it is “Dropped” onto the victim machine to download the second stage of our staged payload. This is a preferred method over Stageless payloads because a small amount of code needs to be written to retrieve the additional parts of the C2 agent from the C2 server. It also makes it easier to obfuscate code to bypass Anti-Virus programs.

**<u>The steps for establishingC2beaconing with a Staged payload are as follows:</u>**

**1.**The Victim downloads and executes the Dropper
**2.**The Dropper calls back to theC2Server for Stage 2
**3.**TheC2Server sends Stage 2 back to the Victim Workstation
**4.**Stage 2 is loaded into memory on the Victim Workstation
**5.**C2Beaconing Initializes, and the Red Teamer/Threat Actors can engage with the Victim on the C2 Server.
