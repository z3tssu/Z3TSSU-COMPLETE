1\. What is C2 Framework?

While trying to digest the various components of a C2 framework, it may be intimidating. However, they don’t have to be.

1.  In order to better understand what a C2 framework is at its most basic level,
2.  think of a Netcat listener (the C2 server) that is capable of handling many reverse shells calling back at once (C2 Agents).
3.  It’s a server but for reverse shells.
4.  Unlike Netcat, almost all C2 frameworks require a special payload generator.
5.  This is usually a feature that is built into the framework itself. For example, Metasploit is a C2 Framework that has its own payload generator, MSFVenom.
