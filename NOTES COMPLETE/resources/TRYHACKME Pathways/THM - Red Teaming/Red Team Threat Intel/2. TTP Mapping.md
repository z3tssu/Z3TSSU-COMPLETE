TTP Mapping is employed by the red cell to map adversaries' collected TTPs to a standard cyber kill chain. Mapping TTPs to a kill chain aids the red team in planning an engagement to emulate an adversary.

To begin the process of mapping TTPs, an adversary must be selected as the target. An adversary can be chosen based on,

1.  Target Industry
2.  Employed Attack Vectors
3.  Country of Origin
4.  Other Factors

As an example for this task, we have decided to use APT 39, a cyber-espionage group run by the Iranian ministry, known for targeting a wide variety of industries.

We will use the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain as our standard cyber kill chain to map TTPs.
