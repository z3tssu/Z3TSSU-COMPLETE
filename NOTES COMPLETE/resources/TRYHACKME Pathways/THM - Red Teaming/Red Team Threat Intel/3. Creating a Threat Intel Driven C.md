**<u>to begin planning a campaign,</u>**

1.  Identify framework and general kill chain
2.  Determine targeted adversary
3.  Identify adversary's TTPs and IOCs
4.  Map gathered threat intelligence to a kill chain or framework
5.  Draft and maintain needed engagement documentation
6.  Determine and use needed engagement resources (tools, C2 modification, domains, etc.)

To make this process simpler we have provided a basic table comparing the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
