4\. Resource Plan
Monday, January 16, 2023
1:12 PM

The resource plan is a document that shows what resources, like people and equipment, are needed for a big test to make sure a website or computer system is safe. It also shows when certain parts of the test will happen, like when they will start looking at the system and when they will try to test if they can get in. It's important to not make the document too long and confusing, and to include only what is needed.
