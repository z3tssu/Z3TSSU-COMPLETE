A Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is like a plan that tells people what will happen during a specific event or project. It's like a summary of what will happen in simple terms, like how a 5-year-old would understand it. This plan is used as a guide for the people who are doing the event and also for the people who hired them to do it.

Example of CONOPS:
