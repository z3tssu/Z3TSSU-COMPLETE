1.  **<u>Metasploit</u>**

- Maintains and run by Rapid7, it is a popular C2 framework that is installed on almost all penetration testing distributions

2.  **<u>Armitage</u>**

- Armitage is an extension of the Metasploit Framework - it adds a Graphical user interface and is written in Java, and is incredibly similar to Cobalt Strike.
- Armitage offers an easy way to enumerate and visualize all of your targets. Aside from looking a lot like Cobalt Strike, it even offers some unique features.
- One of the most popular can be found in the “Attacks” menu; This feature is known as the Hail Mary attack, which attempts to run all exploits for the services running on a specific workstation. Armitage really is “Fast and Easy Hacking”.

3.  **<u>PowerShell Empire</u>**

- PowerShell Empire and Starkiller is another incredibly popular C2 originally created by Harmjoy, Sixdub, and Enigma0x3 from Veris Group. Currently, the project has been discontinued and has been picked up by the BC Security team (Cx01N, Hubbl3, and \_Vinnybod). Empire features agents written in various languages compatible with multiple platforms, making it an incredibly versatile C2.

4.  **<u>Covenant</u>**

- Covenant by Ryan Cobb is the last free C2 Framework we will be covering - By far, it is one of the most unique C2 Frameworks being written in C#. Unlike Metasploit/Armitage, It’s primarily used for post-exploitation and lateral movement with HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB listeners with highly customizable agents.
