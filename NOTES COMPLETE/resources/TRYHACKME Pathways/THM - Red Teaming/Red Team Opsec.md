**<u>Operations Security (OPSEC)</u>**

OPSEC is not a solution or a set of rules; OPSEC is a five-step process to deny adversaries from gaining access to any critical information

<u>The OPSEC process has five steps:</u>

1.  Identify critical information
2.  Analyze threats
3.  Analyze vulnerabilities
4.  Assess risks
5.  Apply appropriate countermeasures
