Red Team Engagements
Sunday, January 15, 2023
4:12 PM

1.  Every red team engagement will start by defining clear goals
2.  remaining undetected and evading any existing security mechanisms like firewalls, antivirus, EDR, IPS and others

\- Technical Infrastructure: Like in a regular penetration test, a red team will try to uncover technical vulnerabilities, with a much higher emphasis on stealth and evasion.
\- Social Engineering: Targeting people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or social media to trick them into revealing information that should be private.
\- Physical Intrusion: Using techniques like lock picking, RFID cloning, exploiting weaknesses in electronic access control devices to access restricted areas of facilities.
