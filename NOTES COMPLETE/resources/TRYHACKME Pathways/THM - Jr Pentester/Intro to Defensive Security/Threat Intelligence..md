Threat intelligence is information about potential security threats to an organization, collected and analyzed in order to help the organization make informed decisions about how to protect itself. This can include information about new types of malware, known vulnerabilities in software, and the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers. The goal of threat intelligence is to give organizations the information they need to proactively identify and defend against potential threats.
