There are many open-source databases out there,

1.  like AbuseIPDB,
2.  and Cisco Talos Intelligence,

where you can perform a reputation and location check for the IP address. Most security analysts use these tools to aid them with alert investigations. You can also make the Internet safer by reporting the malicious IPs, for example, on AbuseIPDB.
