Domain Hierarchy

**<u>TLD (Top-Level Domain)</u>**

A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name.

- So, for example, the tryhackme.com TLD is .com.
- There are two types of TLD, gTLD (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain).
- .com would be for commercial purposes, .org for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government.
- And a ccTLD was used for geographical purposes, for example, .ca for sites based in Canada, .co.uk for sites based in the United Kingdom and so on.
- Due to such demand, there is an influx of new gTLDs ranging from .online , .club , .website , .biz and so many more. For a full list of over 2000 TLDs click here.

**<u>Second-Level Domain</u>**

- -Taking tryhackme.com as an example, the .com part is the TLD, and
- tryhackme is the Second Level Domain.
- second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).

**<u>Subdomain</u>**

- A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain using a period to separate it; for example, in the name admin.tryhackme.com the **admin part** is the subdomain.
A subdomain name has the same creation restrictions as a Second-Level Domain, being limited to 63 characters and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens). You can use multiple subdomains split with periods to create longer names, such as **jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com**. But the length must be kept to 253 characters or less. There is no limit to the number of subdomains you can create for your domain name.
