1.  While viewing a website, you can right-click on the page, and you'll see an option on the menu that says View Page Source.
2.  Most browsers support putting view-source: in front of the URL for example, **view-source:https://www.google.com/**
3.  In your browser menu, you'll find an option to view the page source. This option can sometimes be in submenus such as developer tools or more tools.
