The page source is the **human-readable code returned to our browser/client** from the web server each time we make a request.

- Can be defined as the Frontend of a Website
- The returned code is made up of HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language), CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) and JavaScript
- it's what tells our browser what content to display, how to show it and adds an element of interactivity with JavaScript.
