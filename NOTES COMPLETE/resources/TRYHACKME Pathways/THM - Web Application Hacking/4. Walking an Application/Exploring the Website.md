As a penetration tester, your role when reviewing a website or web application is to discover features that could potentially be vulnerable and attempt to exploit them to assess whether or not they are. **These features are usually parts of the website that require some interactivity with the user.**

- Finding interactive portions of the website can be as easy as spotting a login form to manually reviewing the website's JavaScript.
- An excellent place to start is just with your browser exploring the website and noting down the individual pages/areas/features with a summary for each one.
