In many different programming languages for web applications,
- such as PHP
- file inclusion vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exploited.
- The input validation problem, where user inputs are not sanitized or checked and are instead controlled by the user, is the main problem with these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability arises because the user can call any function with any input when the input is not verified.
