**<u>Search Engines</u>**

Search engines contain trillions of links to more than a billion websites, which can be an excellent resource for finding new subdomains. Using advanced search methods on websites like Google, such as the site: filter, can narrow the search results.

For example, "**-site:www.domain.com site:\*.domain.com**" would only contain results leading to the domain name domain.com but exclude any links to [www.domain.com](http://www.domain.com); therefore, it shows us only subdomain names belonging to domain.com.
