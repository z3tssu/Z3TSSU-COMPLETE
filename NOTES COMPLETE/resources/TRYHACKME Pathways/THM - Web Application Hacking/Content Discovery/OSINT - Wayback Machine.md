**<u>Wayback Machine</u>**

The Wayback Machine (<https://archive.org/web/>) is a historical archive of websites that dates back to the late 90s. You can search a domain name, and it will show you all the times the service scraped the web page and saved the contents. This service can help uncover old pages that may still be active on the current website.
