Content can be many things, a file, video, picture, backup, a website feature.
When we talk about content discovery, we're not talking about the obvious things we can see on a website; it's the things that aren't immediately presented to us and that weren't always intended for public access.

- This content could be, for example, pages or portals intended for staff usage, older versions of the website, backup files, configuration files, administration panels, etc.

- There are three main ways of discovering content on a website which we'll cover. **Manually, Automated and OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence).
