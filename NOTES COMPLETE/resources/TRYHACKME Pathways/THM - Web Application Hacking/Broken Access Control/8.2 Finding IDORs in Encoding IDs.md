**<u>Encoded IDs</u>**
Web developers frequently **take the raw data and encrypt it before transmitting** it from page to page via post data, query strings, or cookies.

- Encoding guarantees that the information will be understandable by the receiving web server.
- Encoding converts binary data into an ASCII string, often using the padding characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and =.
- Base64 encoding is the most widely used encoding method on the web and is typically very obvious.
- You may decode the string using websites like <https://www.base64decode.org/>, update the data, and then re-encode it using <https://www.base64encode.org/> before resubmitting the web request to check whether the answer has changed.
