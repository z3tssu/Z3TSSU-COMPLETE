**<u>An effective way of IDOR detection is</u>**
- create two accounts and switch the ID numbers between them
- if the Id cannot be found using the methods mentioned above.
- You've discovered a legitimate IDOR vulnerability **if you can access the content of other users using their Id number while logged in with a different account** (or not logged in at all).
