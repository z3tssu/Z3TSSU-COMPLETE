- It's possible that the **vulnerable endpoint you're aiming for isn't always visible in the address bar**.
- It may be information that your browser loads in as a result of an AJAX request or material that you discover is mentioned in a JavaScript file.

An unreferenced parameter that may have been useful during development and was sent to production on endpoints occasionally occurs.

For instance, you could see a request to /user/details that displays your user data (authenticated through your session). However, **using a method known as "parameter mining," you find a parameter called "user id"** that you can use to display information about other users, such as **"/user/details?user_id=123."**
