Imagine that you wish to update your profile information after recently signing up for a service online. You may view your information at <http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1305> by clicking the link.

You try **altering the user id value to 1000** instead (<http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1000>) out of curiosity, and to your surprise, **you may now view information belonging to another user**.

**You've now identified an IDOR weakness!** The website need to provide a check to ensure that the user information belongs to the person seeking it.
