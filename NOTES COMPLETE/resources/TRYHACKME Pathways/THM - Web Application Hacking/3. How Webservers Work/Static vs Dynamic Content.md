**<u>Static content,</u>**

- as the name suggests, is content that never changes.
- examples of this are pictures, JavaScript, CSS, etc., HTML that never changes. Furthermore, **these are files that are directly served from the webserver with no changes made to them**.

**<u>Dynamic content,</u>**
- on the other hand, is **content that could change with different requests**.
- for example, a blog. On the homepage of the blog, it will show you the latest entries. If a new entry is created, the home page is then updated with the latest entry, or a second example might be a search page on a blog. Depending on what word you search, different results will be displayed.

**<u>Backend</u>**
- The changes to what you end up seeing
- It's called the Backend because what is being done is all done behind the scenes.
- You can't view the websites' HTML source and see what's happening in the Backend,
- while the HTML is the result of the processing from the Backend.

**<u>Frontend</u>**
- Everything you see in your browser is called the Frontend.
