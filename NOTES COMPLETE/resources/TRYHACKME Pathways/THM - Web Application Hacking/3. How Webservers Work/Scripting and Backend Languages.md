Scripting and Backend Languages

- There's not much of a limit to what a backend language can achieve, and these are what make a website interactive to the user.
- Some examples of these languages (in no particular order :p) are **PHP, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, Perl** and many more.
- These languages can interact with databases, call external services, process data from the user, and so much more. A very basic PHP example of this would be if you requested the website <http://example.com/index.php?name=adam>

- You'll notice that the client doesn't see any PHP code because it's on the **Backend.**
- This interactivity opens up a lot more security issues for web applications that haven't been created securely, as you learn in further modules.
