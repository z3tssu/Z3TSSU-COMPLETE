Consider a Login Form on a webpage
1.  It uses a username and password
2.  The user submits the username: wiener and password: blue cheese
3.  The application checks the credentials by performing the SQL query below:

SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

4.  IF the query returns the details of the user, then the login becomes successful.
5.  IF incorrect the attacker can login as any user and without a password by using SQL comment sequence, to comment out the password part of the login.

<u>Example below:</u>

SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''

**<u>Query to use:</u>**

- Administrator'--

- The query will return the username as administrator and bypass the password field as it will be treated as a comment.

1.  Change the value of username to: **administrator'--**
