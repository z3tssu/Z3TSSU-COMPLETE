**<u>What is Blind SQL Injection?</u>**

- Blind SQL injection occurs when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results, of the injection SQL query.

- Union Attacks are not effective, because they rely on the attacker being able to see the responses of the injected query in the applications responses.

- Different techniques are hence used to exploit Blind SQL injection.
