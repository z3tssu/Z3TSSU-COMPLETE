Assume we have the username: Molly

**<u>Post Web Form:</u>**

We can use Hydra to bruteforce web forms too, you will have to make sure you know which type of request its making - a GET or POST methods are normally used. You can use your browsers network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types, or simply view the source code.

Below is an example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

| Command | hydra -l \<username\> -P \<wordlist\> 10.10.49.17 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V |
