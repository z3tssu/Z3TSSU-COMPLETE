**Method Breakdown**

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:
- There is anFTPserver running on this machine
-  We have a possible username
Using this information, let's try and**bruteforce**the password of theFTPServer.

**Hydra**

Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet,RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub[here](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

**"hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp"**

Let's break it down:

SECTION FUNCTION

hydra Runs the hydra tool

- -t 4 Number of parallel connections per target

- -l \[user\]  Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise

- -P \[path to dictionary\] Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords

- -vV Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt

- \[machine IP\] The IP address of the target machine

- ftp / protocol Sets the protocol

Once you go through the hydra process and receive the password for the user:

- You can log into FTP using the credentials received.
