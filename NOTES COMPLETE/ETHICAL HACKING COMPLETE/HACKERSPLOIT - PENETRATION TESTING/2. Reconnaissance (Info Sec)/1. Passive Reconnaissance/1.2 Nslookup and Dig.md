Commands for using nslookup to find the IP address of a domain name, including query type options and specifying a DNS server, have been explained. The A and AAAA records are used to return IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. To learn about email servers and configurations for a domain, nslookup can be used with the -type=MX option. Additionally, the dig command was introduced as an alternative to nslookup that can provide more detailed information, including the TTL by default.

Examples:

1.  To find the IPv4 addresses of a domain name using Cloudflare's DNS server (1.1.1.1):

| Command | nslookup -type=A google.com 1.1.1.1 |
|---------|-------------------------------------|

2.  To find the Mail Exchange servers of a domain name using the local DNS server:

| Command | nslookup -type=MX yahoo.com |
|---------|-----------------------------|

\# Using Dig

1.  To find the IPv6 addresses of a domain name using Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8):

| Command | dig -6 google.com @8.8.8.8 AAAA |
|---------|---------------------------------|

1.  To find the Start of Authority (SOA) record of a domain name using the local DNS server:

| Command | dig google.com SOA |     |     |
