### What is it?

```markdown
WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification.  The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we can learn:

- Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
- Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
- Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
- Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?
