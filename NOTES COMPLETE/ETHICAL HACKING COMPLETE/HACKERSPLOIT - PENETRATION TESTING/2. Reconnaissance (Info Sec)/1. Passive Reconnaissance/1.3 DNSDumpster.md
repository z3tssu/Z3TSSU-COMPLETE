To avoid such a time-consuming search, one can use an online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as DNSDumpster. If we search DNSDumpster for tryhackme.com, we will discover the subdomain blog.tryhackme.com, which a typical DNS query cannot provide. In addition, DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.
