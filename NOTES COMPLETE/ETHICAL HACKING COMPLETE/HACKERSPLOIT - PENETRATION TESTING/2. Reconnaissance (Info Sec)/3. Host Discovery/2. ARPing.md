# Host Discovery Using ARP

**Purpose:** Use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to discover hosts on a local network segment.

## Basic Usage
- ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.
- ARP requests can be sent to all hosts on the network to discover their presence.

## ARP Requests
- ARP requests are broadcast messages sent to all hosts on the local network.
- Hosts with the requested IP address will reply with their MAC address.

## Tools for ARP Discovery
- **arp**: Command-line tool to view and manipulate the ARP cache.
- **arping**: Send ARP requests to a specific IP address or range.

## Using arping
- Syntax: `arping -c <count> -I <interface> <target>`
- Example: `arping -c 3 -I eth0 192.168.1.1`

## Using ARP for Host Discovery
- ARP can be used to discover hosts on the local network segment without the need for IP addresses.

## Notes
- ARP discovery is limited to the local network segment and does not work across routers or subnets.
- ARP requests can be used to perform reconnaissance or mapping of devices on a network.
