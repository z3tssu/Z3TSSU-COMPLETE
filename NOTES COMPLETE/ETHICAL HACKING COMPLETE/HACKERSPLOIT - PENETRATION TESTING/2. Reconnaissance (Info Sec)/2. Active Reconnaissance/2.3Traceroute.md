**Purpose:** Use the traceroute command to trace the route that packets take from your device to a specified destination, showing each hop along the way.

## Basic Usage

- Example: `traceroute google.com`

## Options
- `-n`: Do not resolve IP addresses to hostnames
- `-w <timeout>`: Set the timeout for each probe (default is 5 seconds)
- `-m <max_ttl>`: Set the maximum TTL (time to live) value for outgoing packets
- `-q <num_probes>`: Set the number of probes per TTL (default is 3)

## Example
