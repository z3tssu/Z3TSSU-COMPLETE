# Netcat Command

**Purpose:** Use the netcat command (often abbreviated as nc) to establish connections to remote systems, perform port scanning, transfer files, and more. Netcat is a versatile networking utility.

## Basic Usage
- Syntax: `nc [options] [hostname/IP] [port]`
- Example: `nc example.com 80`

## Options
- `-l`: Listen mode, for inbound connections
- `-p <port>`: Specify source port (requires root/sudo)
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-z`: Zero-I/O mode, for scanning
- `-u`: Use UDP instead of TCP
- `-e <command>`: Execute command after connecting (dangerous, use with caution)

## Examples
- To connect to a web server on example.com on port 80:
```sh
  nc example.com 80
```
