Enumeration is the process of actively gathering information about a target system or network during a penetration testing (pentest) engagement. There are several methods of enumeration that can be used in a pentest, including:

**<u>Network scanning:</u>**

This involves using tools such as Nmap, Nessus, or OpenVAS to identify open ports, running services, and operating systems on a target system or network.

**<u>SNMP enumeration:</u>**

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used to manage and monitor network devices. SNMP enumeration involves using tools such as snmpwalk or onesixtyone to retrieve information from SNMP-enabled devices.

**<u>DNS enumeration:</u>**

This involves using tools such as nslookup or dig to gather information about a target's DNS records, such as hostnames, IP addresses, and MX records.

**<u>SMB enumeration:</u>**

Server Message Block (SMB) is a protocol used for file sharing and network printing. SMB enumeration involves using tools such as enum4linux or nbtscan to gather information about a target's SMB shares and connected users.

**<u>RDP enumeration:</u>**

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol used to remotely access and control a computer. RDP enumeration involves using tools such as rdesktop or ncrack to attempt to connect to a target's RDP service and gather information about connected users.

**<u>HTTP enumeration:</u>**

This involves using tools such as curl, wget, or Burp Suite to interact with a target's web services and gather information about the web server, application, and potential vulnerabilities.

**<u>7.LDAP enumeration:</u>**

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol used for storing and retrieving information from a directory service. LDAP enumeration involves using tools such as ldapsearch or JXplorer to gather information from LDAP-enabled services.
