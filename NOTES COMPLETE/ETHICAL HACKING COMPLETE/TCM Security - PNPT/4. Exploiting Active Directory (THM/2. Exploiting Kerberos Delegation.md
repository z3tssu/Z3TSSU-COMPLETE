- Kerberos Delegation allows applications to access resources on a different server without compromising security.

- Unconstrained Delegation is less secure, as it provides no limits on delegation

- Constrained Delegation limits the services an account can delegate to, reducing the risk of exposure if an account is compromised.

- Resource-Based Constrained Delegation is an even more secure method, as it allows the service owner to control who can access it by specifying which objects can delegate to it.
