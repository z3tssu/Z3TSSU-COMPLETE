There are a few ways to do this.

1.  Invoke-Bloodhound \| From Powershell
2.  Sharphound \| Written in C#

We will be using the Invoke-Bloodhound from Powershell

## Steps 1: Look for invoke-bloodhound on google.

Use the command:

- It will collect all the data.

## Step 6: Import the data into Bloodhound.

## Step 7: Accessing Bloodhound Features:

- If you use the query find all domain admin, the above will be displayed.

## Step 9: Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins:

- In this example, it will show that the Administrator@marvel.local, has a session on the machine THEPUNISHER@marvel.local
- You can then begin to get ideas of leveraging this, by finding ways of exploiting the information gathered.
- You will be thinking, well if I can get access to THEPUNISHER computer, you can get the domain admin account that will be the shortest path to the domain admin.

## Step 10: Look through the differed Queries of the vast amount of data that they provide

- You can also look for guidelines and tutorials of bloodhound, since it is a really powerful tool.
