Determine Spooler Service is Running

We need to determine if the Print Spooler service is running. Since we don't have access to THMSERVER2, we need to query from the network perspective. In this case, we can use a WMI query from our SSH session on THMWRK1 to query the service's current state:

## SSH Session on THMWRK1 (cmd)

| Command | GWMI Win32_Printer -Computer thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|

## Powershell Method

| Command | Get-PrinterPort -ComputerName thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
