\# Basics

Let's say you have dumped the SAM hashes:

- Put it inside a text document
- These hashes are called NTLM
- They are the local hashes when you dump a SAM
- They are stored under module 1000
- You can pass around NTLM hashes, but you cannot pass around NTLMv2

\# Using Hashcat

| Command | Hashcat64.exe -m 1000 (hash_file.txt) rockyou.txt -O |
