Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network however we'll be using mimikatz in order to dump a TGT from LSASS memory

**<u>Pass the Ticket Overview -</u>**

1.  Pass the ticket is a type of cyber attack used for privilege escalation and lateral movement in a network.
2.  It involves dumping the Kerberos Tickets from the LSASS memory of a machine.
3.  LSASS is a memory process that stores credentials on an active directory server and acts as a gatekeeper to accept or reject credentials provided.
4.  The dumped ticket can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in the LSASS memory.
5.  This attack is helpful for privilege escalation and lateral movement if there are unsecured domain service account tickets lying around.
6.  The attack does not create or destroy any tickets but reuses an existing ticket from another user on the domain and impersonates that ticket.
