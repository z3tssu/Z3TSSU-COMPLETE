- **Authentication Service (AS)**- The Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domainto request access to other machines and service tickets.
- **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**- The Ticket Granting Service takes theTGTand returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
- **Service Principal Name (SPN)**- A Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account which is why a service needs an SPN set.
- **KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key)**- The KDC key is based on the KRBTGTservice account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.
- **Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key)**- The client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
- **Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key)**- The service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
- **Session Key**- Issued by the KDC when aTGTis issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
