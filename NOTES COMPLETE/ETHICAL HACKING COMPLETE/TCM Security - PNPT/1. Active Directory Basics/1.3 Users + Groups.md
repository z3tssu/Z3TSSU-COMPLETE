### Users Overview

	﻿Users are the core to Active Directory; without users why have Active Directory in the first place? There are four main types of users you'll find in an Active Directory network; however, there can be more depending on how a company manages the permissions of its users. The four types of users are:

- Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
- Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
- Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
- Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.

### Groups Overview

	﻿Groups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions. There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups:

1. Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
2. Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

## Default Security Groups 

	﻿There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group. Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

- Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
- Domain Guests - All domain guests
- Domain Users - All domain users
- Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
- Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
- Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
- Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
- DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
- DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
- Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
- Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
- Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
- Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939> for more information.
- Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
- Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain
- Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise
- Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain.
- Enterprise Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest.
