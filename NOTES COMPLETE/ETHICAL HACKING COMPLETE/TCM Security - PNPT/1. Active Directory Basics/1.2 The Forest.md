The forest is what defines everything; it is the container that holds all of the other bits and pieces of the network together. When we say "forest", it is only a way of describing the connection created between these trees and domains by the network.

## Forest Overview

	﻿﻿A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

```markdown
- Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
- Domains - Used to group and manage objects
- Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
- Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
- Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
- Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
- Domain Schema - Rules for object creation
```
