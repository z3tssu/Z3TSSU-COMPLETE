Title: PSEXEC Execute Process Remotely

- ### Psexec Overview:
  - Psexec is a widely used method for executing processes remotely.
  - It is part of the Sysinternals Tools and can be downloaded from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec).
  - Requires access to the Admin\$ share and membership in the Administrators group.

- ### Psexec Workflow:
  1. Connect to the Admin\$ share and upload the service binary (psexesvc.exe).
  2. Access the service control manager to create and run a service named PSEXESVC, associating it with C:\Windows\psexesvc.exe.
  3. Create named pipes for handling stdin/stdout/stderr.

- ### Running Psexec:
  - To execute Psexec, provide the necessary administrator credentials for the remote host and the desired command.
  - Example command using PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    psexec64.exe \\MACHINE_IP -u Administrator -p Mypass123 -i cmd.exe
    ```

Note: Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and follow security best practices when using Psexec or any remote execution tool.
