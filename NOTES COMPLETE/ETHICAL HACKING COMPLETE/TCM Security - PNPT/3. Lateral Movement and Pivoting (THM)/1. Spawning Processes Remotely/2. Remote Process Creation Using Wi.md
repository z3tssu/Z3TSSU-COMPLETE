Remote Process Creation Using WinRM

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a web-based protocol used to send Powershell commands to Windows hosts remotely. Most Windows Server installations will have WinRM enabled by default, making it an attractive attack vector.

### To connect to a remote Powershell session from the command line, 

we can use the following command:

```cmd
winrs.exe -u:Administrator -p:Mypass123 -r:target cmd
```

### Using Powershell

### Create a PSCredential object:

```powershell
\$username= 'Administrator';\$password= 'Mypass123';\$securePassword= ConvertTo-SecureString\$password-AsPlainText -Force;\$credential= New-ObjectSystem.Management.Automation.PSCredential \$username,\$securePassword;
```

### Create an interactive session using the Enter-PSSession cmdlet:

```powershell
Enter-PSSession-Computername TARGET -Credential $credential
```

Powershell also includes the Invoke-Command cmdlet, which runs ScriptBlocks remotely via WinRM. Credentials must be passed through a PSCredential object as well:

```powershell
Invoke-Command-Computername TARGET -Credential \$credential-ScriptBlock {whoami}
```
