Here is the reorganized information on Pass-the-Ticket:

**Pass-the-Ticket:**

Pass-the-Ticket is a technique that involves extracting Kerberos tickets and session keys from LSASS memory using mimikatz. This process typically requires SYSTEM privileges on the target machine and can be performed as follows:

1. Use mimikatz to debug the privilege and export Kerberos tickets from LSASS memory:
   ```
   mimikatz # privilege::debug
   mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
   ```

   - Both the Kerberos ticket and its corresponding session key are necessary for successful use of the ticket.
   - Extracting Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) is usually the primary focus, as they grant access to any services the user is allowed to access.
   - Extracting Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets is limited to the specific services assigned to the account.

2. Once the desired ticket has been extracted, inject it into the current session using the following command:
   ```
   mimikatz # kerberos::ptt [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi
   ```

   - Injecting tickets into the current session does not require administrator privileges.
   - The injected tickets will be available for any lateral movement tools used.

3. To verify if the tickets were successfully injected, use the `klist` command:
   ```
   THMJMP2: Powershell 
   C:\> klist
   ```

   - The output will show the current logon ID and cached tickets, including the client, server, encryption type, ticket flags, start time, end time, renewal time, session key, cache flags, and KDC information.

This technique allows an attacker to reuse valid Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to services without needing the user's plaintext password.
