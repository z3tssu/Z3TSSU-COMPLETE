The authentication process using NTLM (NT LAN Manager) can be summarized as follows:

1. The client initiates the authentication process by sending an authentication request to the server they want to access.

2. The server responds by generating a random number, known as a challenge, and sends it back to the client.

3. The client combines their NTLM password hash with the challenge and other known data to generate a response to the challenge. This response is then sent back to the server for verification.

4. The server forwards both the challenge and the response to the Domain Controller, which is responsible for user authentication and authorization.

5. The Domain Controller uses the received challenge to independently recalculate the expected response based on the user's NTLM password hash. It then compares the calculated response with the response sent by the client. If the two responses match, the client's authentication is considered successful; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.

6. The server receives the authentication result from the Domain Controller and forwards it to the client. Based on this result, the client is granted or denied access to the requested resource.

This process provides a basic overview of how NTLM authentication works, involving challenges, responses, and verification with the help of a Domain Controller.
