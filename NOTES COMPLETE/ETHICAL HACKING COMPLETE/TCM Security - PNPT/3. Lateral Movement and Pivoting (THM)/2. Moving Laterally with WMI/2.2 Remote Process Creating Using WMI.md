To remotely spawn a process using WMI in PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. Assuming you have already established a WMI session and stored it in the `$Session` variable, you can use the following command to create a process:
   ```powershell
   $Command = "powershell.exe -Command Set-Content -Path C:\text.txt -Value munrawashere"
   Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments @{CommandLine = $Command}
   ```
   Replace `C:\text.txt` with the desired file path and `munrawashere` with the content you want to write to the file. The process will be created silently, and you won't be able to see the command's output.

2. On legacy systems, you can use the `wmic` command from the command prompt to achieve the same result. Run the following command:
   ```batch
   wmic.exe /user:Administrator /password:Mypass123 /node:TARGET process call create "cmd.exe /c calc.exe"
   ```
   Replace `Administrator` with the appropriate username, `Mypass123` with the password, and `TARGET` with the target computer name or IP address. This command will create a new process to execute `calc.exe`.

Make sure to adjust the commands and parameters according to your specific scenario.

Note: The required ports for WMI communication are 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC), and either 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS). The user account used for the remote process creation should have the necessary permissions, such as being a member of the Administrators group.
