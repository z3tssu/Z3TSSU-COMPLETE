To establish a WMI session from PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. Create a PSCredential object with your username and password. Store it in the `$credential` variable. Replace `Administrator` with your username and `Mypass123` with your password:
   ```powershell
   $username = 'Administrator'
   $password = 'Mypass123'
   $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
   $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword
   ```

2. Establish a WMI session using either the DCOM or Wsman protocol. Use the following commands and store the session in the `$Session` variable:
   - DCOM Protocol (RPC over IP):
     ```powershell
     $Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
     $Session = New-CimSession -ComputerName TARGET -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
     ```

   - Wsman Protocol (WinRM):
     ```powershell
     $Session = New-CimSession -ComputerName TARGET -Credential $credential -UseSSL -ErrorAction Stop
     ```
     Replace `TARGET` with the target computer name or IP address.

3. The `New-CimSessionOption` cmdlet is used to configure the connection options for the WMI session, including the connection protocol. The options and credentials are then passed to the `New-CimSession` cmdlet to establish a session against the remote host.

You can now use the `$Session` variable to perform various WMI operations and interact with the remote system.

Note: Make sure to replace `TARGET` with the actual target computer name or IP address.
