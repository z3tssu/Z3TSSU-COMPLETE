To remotely install an MSI package on a target system using WMI and PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. Assuming you have established a WMI session and stored it in the `$Session` variable, you can use the following PowerShell command to install the MSI package:

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```

Replace `"C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"` with the actual path to the MSI file on the target system. Adjust the options and all users settings (`$false` for current user, `$true` for all users) as needed.

2. If you are working with legacy systems and prefer to use `wmic`, you can use the following command:

```bash
wmic /node:TARGET /user:DOMAIN\USER product call install PackageLocation=c:\Windows\myinstaller.msi
```

Replace `TARGET` with the hostname or IP address of the target system, and `DOMAIN\USER` with the appropriate domain and user credentials. Adjust the `PackageLocation` parameter to the actual path of the MSI file.

Ensure that the required ports for WMI communication are open: 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC), and either 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS). The user account used for the installation should have the necessary permissions, such as being a member of the Administrators group.
