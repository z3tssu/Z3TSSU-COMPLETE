Example 2: Tunneling Complex Exploits

## Objective:

The THMDC server is running a vulnerable version of Rejetto HFS and we can exploit that

## Problem:

- Firewall rule restrict access to the vulnerable port
- Can only be viewed from THMJMP2
- Outbound connections only allowed to internal network machine
- Rejetto HFS exploit requires the attacker to host an HTTP server to trigger the final payload
- no outbound connections are allowed to the attacker's machine
- find a way to host a web server in one of the other machines in the same network, which is not at all convenient

## Solution

- use port forwarding to overcome all of these problems
