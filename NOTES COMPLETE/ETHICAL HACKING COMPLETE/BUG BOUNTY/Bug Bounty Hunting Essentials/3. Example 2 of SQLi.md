**<u>Example:</u>**

Website URL if it contains id=1, as seen below.

![image1](image1-181.png)

- That directly means, that each blog has a unique ID

To retrieve this data the web application will retrieve the information from the database as followed:

SELECT \* from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;

1.  Id= means the identification of the blog
2.  Private=0 its able to be viewed by the public

**<u>Example 2:</u>**

Let's pretend a blog article id 2 is locked and private, you can call the URL using the below:

- **<https://website.thm/blog?id=2>;--**

Which would produce the SQL statement of:

- SELECT \* from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1;

**<u>IMPORTANT</u>**

- The semicolon (;) signifies the end of the SQL statement
- The two dashes cause everything after the SQL statement to be treated as a comment.
