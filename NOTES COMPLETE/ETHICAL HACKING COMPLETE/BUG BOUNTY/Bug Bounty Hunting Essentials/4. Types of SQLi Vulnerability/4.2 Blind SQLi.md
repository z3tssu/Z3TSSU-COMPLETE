**For Blind SQLi,**

- Occurs when injecting SQL into a website but you get little to no response, regardless of whether the injection has worked or not.
- the attacker is not able to directly see the response of the injected queries.
- Instead, this kind of vulnerability is exploited when the attacker enumerates the database by observing the application's behavior.

**<u>Example of Blind SQLi:</u>**

Authentication Bypass:

- SQL Injection technique to bypass login forms
- Not interested in retrieving data from the database, just want to get past the login
- Just need to create a database query that replies with yes/true

**<u>Simple query to the database can be as followed:</u>**

select \* from users where username='%username%' and password='%password%' LIMIT 1;

1.  N.B The **%username%** and **%password%** values are taken from the login form fields, the initial values in the SQL Query box will be blank as these fields are currently empty.

1.  To make this into a query that always returns as true, we can enter the following into the password field:

1.  **' OR 1=1;--**

**<u>Which turns the SQL query into the following:</u>**

**select \* from users where username='' and password='' OR 1=1;**

1.  1=1 is a true statement and we've used an OR operator, this **will always cause the query to return as true**
2.  satisfies the web applications logic that the database found a valid username/password combination and that access should be allowed.
