4.2.2 Time-based Blind SQLi

Time-based blind SQLi

1.  A time-based blind SQL Injection is very similar to the above Boolean based

- same requests are sent, but there is no visual indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time.
- Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on the time the query takes to complete.
- This time delay is introduced by using built-in methods such as SLEEP(x) alongside the UNION statement.
- The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT statement.

2.  So, for example, when trying to establish the number of columns in a table, you would use the following query:

- admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5);--

3.  If there was no pause in the response time, we know that the query was unsuccessful, so like on previous tasks, we add another column:

- admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;--

4.  This payload **should have produced a 5-second time delay, which confirms the successful execution of the UNION statement and that there are two columns.**

- You can now repeat the enumeration process from the Boolean based SQL Injection, adding the SLEEP() method into the UNION SELECT statement.

- If you're struggling to find the table name the below query should help you on your way:

- referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 where database() like 'u%';--

5.  The final database name would be "sql" as followed:

**<u>Enumerating Table Name:</u>**

1.  Following the necessary step you can use the command as shown below but including the SLEEP(5,)2:

- admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sql' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';
