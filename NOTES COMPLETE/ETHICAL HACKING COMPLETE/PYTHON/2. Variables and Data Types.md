\# What is a Variable?

- A container that can store data values
- You can modify their value

\#Types of Variable:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 53%" />
<col style="width: 46%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<p>age = 27</p>
<p>number_of_friends = 10</p>
<p>number_of_apples = 5</p></th>
<th><p># Floats</p>
