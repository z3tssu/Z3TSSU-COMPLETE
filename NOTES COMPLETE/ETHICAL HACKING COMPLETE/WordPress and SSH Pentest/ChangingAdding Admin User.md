\> We can view the users that has been created and now we can perform priviliage escallation by changing the administrator (michael) password

\> However when performing RED-TEAMING it is not advised to change the password of the admin as you want to remain as undetected as possible, because the admin may realize that his password has been changed

\> Instead you would want to create a new user and give them the necessary priviliage
