## What you'll learn

- What threat phishing presents to an organization 
    
- What different types of phishing emails look like
    
- How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats
    

## What you'll do

- Examine an obvious fake email and make it more believable
## Your task is to create a believable phishing email

Your manager wants you to lead Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign. This is an awesome opportunity for you to step up and show what you can do.

The first step is to create the fake phishing email to use in the simulation.

You’ve just seen what an ‘obvious fake’ looks like, so it’s important to make yours **contextual** and **believable** to increase the likelihood of an employee clicking on the phishing link.

## Improve the phishing email

Using the text box below, you need to **recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable.** Remember the end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:

- Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a Mastercard employee
- Mask the hyperlink within text
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Add points of legitimacy

# Task 2

## What you'll learn

- How to identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing
    
- How to design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack
    

## What you'll do

- Create a short presentation to help teams improve security awareness


## Interpret the results

First, let’s have a look at the results of the phishing campaign.

This table helps you to identify which teams appear to be **more likely** to fall for a phishing email than others.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Team**|**Email open rate**|**Email click-through rate**|**Phishing success rate**|
|IT|80%|2%|0%|
|HR|100%|85%|75%|
|Card Services|60%|50%|10%|
|Reception|40%|10%|0%|
|Engineering|70%|4%|1%|
|Marketing|65%|40%|38%|
|R&D|50%|5%|2%|
|**Overall average**|**66%**|**28%**|**18%**|

When you’re ready, start the quick quiz to see if you’ve correctly identified the most vulnerable teams. 

## Here are some resources to help you

The percentages shown are based off the total number of staff members who **received** the email. 

For example if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it - the email open rate would be 50%.

- **Email open rate** = the percentage of people that opened it
- **Email click-through rate** = the percentage of people that clicked on the link
- **Phishing success rate** = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information
