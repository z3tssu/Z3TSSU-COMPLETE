You are expected to report your findings on each email, so that we can either block or release these emails to the users.

# Task 2 - Investigate suspicious network activity

## What you'll learn

- How to investigate suspicious network activity coming from a user on your network
    

## What you'll do

- Examine a packet capture file containing a user's recent network activity
    
- Produce a report identifying any artifacts the user may have accessed

## Here is the background information on your task

Suspicious network activity has been detected coming from a user on the ANZ network. 

A laptop has been flagged up on our security systems due to suspicious internet traffic, and we need you to investigate the network traffic in order to establish what the user accessed and downloaded.

Your task is to examine their network activity and gather what information you can on what images they viewed and what files they accessed. 

You have been provided with a packet capture file (pcap) containing all their recent network activity. There may be a number of artifacts contained within the packet capture file, and you will be expected to identify and report as many as possible. 

**You must provide a report on everything you found, and document what processes / steps you followed to achieve this**

## Here is your task

You will need to use Wireshark and a Hex-editor in order to fully investigate the packets of network traffic and to open the pcap file.
