The Act can be used to initiate proceedings to confiscate the property and prevent the person from disposing of or dealing with it.

**Process:**

1. The Director or Deputy Director of the Act can state in proceedings that they believe the respondent is in possession or control of specified property that constitutes benefit from criminal conduct.
2. The Court will consider the evidence and if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the belief, the statement will be considered as evidence of the property and its value.
3. The applicant must make the application and submit evidence based on credible and reliable information that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the respondent's possession or control of the property and its value.
4. The Court may make an interim order prohibiting the person from disposing of or dealing with the property if it meets the criteria of constituting benefit from criminal conduct and having a value of not less than R50,000.
5. The Court may appoint a receiver to take possession of the property and manage it according to the Court's directions.
6. The Court may also make a disposal order, transferring the property to the Republic or another specified person, depriving the respondent of their rights in the property.

This Act provides a legal framework for the confiscation of property obtained through criminal conduct and aims to prevent the disposal or diminishing of the value of such property
