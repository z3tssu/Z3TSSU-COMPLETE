# Implementing ISO 27001

## Step 1: Define Your Strategy for Information n Security

- To preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customers data
- To assure customers that (Company_name) is well managed and professional organization
- To give confidence to the customer's IT department
- To use best practice for its information security
- To be compliant with other standards, GDPR, POPI, Privacy Acts
## Step 2: Create a "Statement of Applicability"

- 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment
- d) produce a statement of applicability that contain the necessary controls (see 6.1.3 b) and c)) and justifications for inclusions, whether they are implemented or not, and the justification for exclusions on controls from Annex A
- Basically take all controls (107) of Annex A (put in a spreadsheet) and defines the ones you are including and excluding from your systems
- Justify why you have included them
- justify why you have excluded some
## Step 3: Conduct Risk Management Methods
> The Majority of the work is this step
1. Define the scope, context and the risk criteria 
2. Ensure that staff are involved and participate 
3. Information Asset Identification
	1. Digital - Data Stored (databases)
	2. Material form - Paper-based, whiteboards, desks
	3. Knowledge - know-how employees, contractors
	4. Hardware & Software
4. Conduct the risk assessment
	1. Risk Identification
	2. Risk Analysis
	3. Risk Evaluation
5. Determine the risk treatments
6. Monitor and continuously review progress
7. Make sure that its easy to record and report risks and opportunities
8. `Step by Step Guide to Implementation
	![[Pasted image 20240314101854.png]]
	1. Asset Register
	2. ``Classification Register``
		1. ![[Pasted image 20240314102019.png]]
		2. Classify them into priority based on importance
			1. Private
			2. Confidential
			3. In-House
			4. Public
	3. ``Information Security Risk Register``
		1. Risk Register
			1. Item
			2. Vulnerability
			3. Harm
			4. Risk Level (High, Medium, Low)
			5. Controls and Actions
			6. Residual Risk Level
			7. Mitigations
			8. Contingency Steps
	4. 
## Step 4: Implement Controls
> Controls are based on the Annex A | ISO 27002

- Whatever you defined in step 3 as a control, you use the Annex A to implement them.
- Annex A Controls
	1. A5 Information Security Policies (2 Controls)
	2. A6 Organization of Information Security (7 controls)
	3. A7 Human Resource Security (6 Controls)
	4. A8 Asset Management (10 Controls)
	5. A9 Access Control (14 Controls)
	6. A10 Cryptography (2 Controls)
	7. A11 Physical and Environmental Security (15 controls)
	8. A12 Operations Security (14 controls)
	9. A13 Communication Security (7 Controls)
	10. A14 System acquisition, development and maintenance (7 controls)
	11. A15 Supplier Relationship (5 controls)
	12. A16 Information Security Incident Management (7 controls)
	13. A17 Business continuity (4 controls)
	14. A18 Compliance (8 controls)

## Step 5: Implement Management System

1. Write Your ISMS Manual
	1. Clause 4 Context of the Organization
	2. Clause 5 Leadership
	3. Clause 6 Planning
	4. Clause 7 Support
	5. Clause 8 Operation
	6. Clause 9 Performance Evaluation
	7. Clause 10 Improvement
2. Implement the Manual
