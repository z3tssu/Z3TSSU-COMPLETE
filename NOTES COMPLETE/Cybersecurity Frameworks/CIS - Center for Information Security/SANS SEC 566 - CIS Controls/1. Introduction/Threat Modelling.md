## Type of Threat Modelling 
Formerly known as the [[Open Threat Taxonomy]]
- Hundreds of organizations have contributed
- One of the latest efforts is the release of a community threat model, which will be used to document and prioritize threats
- CTM will be used to define threats to define controls
- Will help standardize risk assessments, make one less paperwork step for organizations to complete

### Project Goal 

- Catalog all potential threats in the area as a precursor to control selection. Understanding threats allows for better determination of defensive controls.

**Focus of the Model:** 
- **Threat Actions:** Identifying actions that can be taken by threats.
- **Exclusion of Threat Sources or Actors:** Focus on actions rather than sources or actors for more useful intelligence in control selection.

**Community Effort:** Designed as a community effort to save organizations from individually cataloging threat information.

**Input to CIS Controls Project:** Currently used as input to the CIS Controls project, seen as a community risk assessment methodology.
