## Basic Categories of Risk Management
• There are two basic categories of every risk management framework

1. Risk Management for the Purpose of Control Selection
	- Goal: To identify an appropriate list of controls to ensure business objectives are achieved
2. Risk Management for the Purpose of Gap Analysis
	- Goal: To ensure an organization has implemented all appropriate controls on appropriate systems and processes


1. What controls should an organization implement to defend specific information systems?
2. How mature is the organization in implementing appropriate controls on specific systems?

### In an ideal world, every organization would 
1. Inventory and evaluate potential threats, 
2. Map those threats to effective controls to limit the threats 
3. Implement those controls comprehensively. 

## Steps in the Full Risk Management Process 

1. Threat Inventory
2. [[Threat Modelling ]]
3. [[Control Inventory ]]
4. Map Threats to Controls 
5. Control Prioritization
6. Asset Classification
7. Control Implementation
8. Control Validation
9. Risk Reporting 
10. Risk Response

## Risk Management  Maturity Levels 

---

It is assumed that not every organization will be at the maturity level where they can perform each of the ten steps mentioned in this process. In fact, it is assumed that most organizations will only focus on risk assessment for the purpose of gap analysis, rather than attempting to do this for the purpose of their own control selection. Using Carnegie Mellon’s maturity model, organizations will engage in the following phases of risk management based on their overall maturity in this area:

#### Initial:
- Control Inventory
- Control Prioritization
- Control Implementation
- Control Validation

#### Managed:
- Control Inventory
- Control Prioritization
- Control Implementation
- Control Validation
- Risk Reporting
- Risk Response

#### Defined:
- Control Inventory
- Control Prioritization
- Asset Classification
- Control Implementation
- Control Validation
- Risk Reporting
- Risk Response

#### Quantitatively Defined:
- Control Inventory
- Control Prioritization
- Asset Classification
- Control Implementation
- Control Validation
- Risk Reporting
- Risk Response

#### Optimizing:
- Threat Inventory
- Threat Modeling
- Control Inventory
- Map Threats to Controls
- Control Prioritization
- Asset Classification
- Control Implementation
- Control Validation
- Risk Reporting
- Risk Response
