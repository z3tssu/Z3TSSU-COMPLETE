## Controls, Measures, Metrics and Maturity

Many organizations have expressed interest in being able to utilize measures or metrics to quantify the maturity of their organization. Since the introduction of the CIS Controls, the developers of the controls have provided specific measures that an organization may consider when determining their level of maturity. This can be used to measure the organizationâ€™s progress towards their goal as well as help compare the organization against their
peers.

#### The process CIS has defined for this has been:
1. Define the Control
2. Define a Specific Measure for that Control
3. Define a Metric (Judgement) for the Measure
4. Define Maturity based on Metrics
