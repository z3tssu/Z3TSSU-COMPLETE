## The State of Cybersecurity Standards
• Creating a control inventory lays the foundation for future action by
defining potential defenses an organization could implement
• The goal is to clarify what defenses are available to an organization to be able to defend itself
• Numerous control inventories (libraries) have been created over the years to help provide guidance in this area
• “Most cybersecurity frameworks are simply copied and pasted from other existing cybersecurity frameworks.”


## Popular CyberSecurity Control Standards
• In the cybersecurity industry there are dozens of international control standards for organizations to choose from

### Some of the most popular standards include:
#### 1. Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls (v8.0)
#### 2. NIST SP 800-171 (rev2)

• Maintained by the US National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST)
• Originally developed to provide a framework for protection Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal
systems
• Designed as a simplified, prioritized set of controls taken from NIST SP 800-53
• Primarily defines technical infrastructure defenses, with some
governance and operational controls
#### 3. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
#### 4. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (v1.1)
#### 5. ISO 27002:2013
#### 6. Australian CyberSecurity Centre (ACIS) Essential Eight

• Developed & Maintained by the Australian CyberSecurity Centre (ACIS)
• “The Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents is a prioritized list of mitigation strategies to assist organizations in protecting their systems against a range of adversaries.”
