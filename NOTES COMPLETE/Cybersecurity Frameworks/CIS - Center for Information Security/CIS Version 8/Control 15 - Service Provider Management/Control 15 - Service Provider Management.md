# Overview 

Develop a process to evaluate service providers who hold sensitive data, or are responsible for an enterprise’s critical IT platforms or processes, to ensure these providers are protecting those platforms and data appropriately.
# Why is this Control critical

### Importance of Third-Party Security
- **Modern Enterprise Reliance**: Enterprises rely on vendors and partners for data management and infrastructure.
- **Impact of Breaches**: Third-party breaches can significantly impact an enterprise, as seen in examples like payment card compromises and ransomware attacks.

### Regulatory Requirements
- **Data Security Regulations**: Regulations require protection to extend to third-party service providers (e.g., HIPAA, FFIEC, U.K. Cyber Essentials).
- **Core GRC Function**: Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function.

### Challenges in Third-Party Security Assessment
- **Lack of Universal Standard**: There is no universal standard for assessing third-party security.
- **Multiple Audits Impact Productivity**: Service providers are audited by customers multiple times a month, impacting their productivity.
- **Diverse Checklists and Standards**: Every enterprise has a different checklist or set of standards to grade service providers.

### Industry Standards and Tools
- **Shared Assessments Program**: A standard in finance for assessing third-party security.
- **HECVAT**: Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit used in higher education.
- **Insurance Company Standards**: Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their own measurements.

### Risks Associated with Small Firms
- **Greater Risk from Smaller Firms**: Smaller firms can pose a greater risk, especially if they contract with additional parties to provide services to the main enterprise.

# Procedures and tools

### Use of Standard Checklists
- **Traditional Approach**: Enterprises have traditionally used standard checklists, such as those from ISO 27001 or the CIS Controls.
- **Shift to Online Platforms**: While these processes were traditionally managed through spreadsheets, there are now online platforms for central management.

### Focus on Fundamentals
- **Fundamental Program Focus**: The focus of third-party risk management should be on the fundamentals of the program.
- **Annual Reassessment**: Revisit the program annually as relationships and data may change.

### Policy and Inventory
- **Review Policy**: Every enterprise, regardless of size, should have a policy for reviewing service providers.
- **Vendor Inventory**: Maintain an inventory of vendors with a risk rating associated with their potential impact to the business.

### Contract Language
- **Accountability in Contracts**: Ensure there is language in contracts to hold service providers accountable for incidents that impact the enterprise.

### Third-Party Assessment Platforms
- **Central View of Industry**: Use third-party assessment platforms to get a central view of the industry and make more informed risk decisions.
- **Dynamic Risk Score**: These platforms often provide a dynamic risk score for service providers based on assessments.

### Focus of Reviews
- **Focus on Supporting Services**: When performing reviews, focus on the services or departments of the provider that are supporting the enterprise.
- **Managed Security Services and Cybersecurity Insurance**: Consider providers with managed security service contracts or cybersecurity insurance for risk reduction.

### Secure Decommissioning
- **Securely Decommission Providers**: When contracts are completed or terminated, ensure secure decommissioning activities including user and service account deactivation, termination of data flows, and secure disposal of enterprise data within service provider systems.

### Additional Resources
- **NIST 800-88r1**: Refer to NIST 800-88r1 for guidelines for media sanitization, as appropriate. [Link](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf)
