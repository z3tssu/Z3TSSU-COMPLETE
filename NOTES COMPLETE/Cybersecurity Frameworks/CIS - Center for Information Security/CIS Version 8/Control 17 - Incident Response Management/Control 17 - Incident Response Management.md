# Overview 

Establish a program to develop and maintain an incident response capability (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, defined roles, training, and communications) to prepare, detect, and quickly respond to an attack.

# Why is this Control critical

### Comprehensive Cybersecurity Program Components:
1. **Protections**: Implement measures to prevent cyber threats.
2. **Detections**: Utilize tools and methods to identify cyber threats.
3. **Response**: Develop strategies to respond to and contain cyber incidents.
4. **Recovery**: Establish procedures to recover from cyber incidents.

### Importance of Response and Recovery:
- In immature enterprises, response and recovery may be overlooked.
- Incident response aims to identify, respond to, and remediate threats promptly.
- Understanding incidents prevents a "whack-a-mole" approach.

### Incident Response Plan:
- Essential for effective incident management.
- Guides investigative procedures, reporting, data collection, and legal protocols.
- Enables successful incident understanding, management, and recovery.

### Communication and Stakeholders:
- Critical for reducing material impact from cyber events.
- Leadership needs to understand potential impacts to prioritize remediation.
- Factors influencing decisions include regulatory compliance, disclosure rules, revenue, and mission impacts.

### Dwell Time and Attack Impact:
- Dwell time (time from attack to detection) can be prolonged.
- Longer dwell times enable attackers to embed deeper and maintain persistent access.
- Rise of ransomware highlights the criticality of dwell time, especially with data theft tactics.

### Conclusion:
- A comprehensive cybersecurity program must prioritize response and recovery alongside protection and detection.
- Effective incident response plans and communication strategies are essential for minimizing the impact of cyber incidents.

# Procedures and Tools

### Importance of Incident Response Planning:
- **Plan Necessity**: Even resource-constrained enterprises need an incident response plan.
- **Plan Components**: Plan should include sources for protections and detections, contact list, and communication strategies for various stakeholders.

### Incident Response Training:
- **Scenario-Based Training**: Regular training is crucial for incident response teams.
- **Scenario Purpose**: Helps teams understand their roles and prepares them to handle incidents effectively.
- **Identifying Gaps**: Training scenarios often reveal plan and process gaps, allowing for updates and improvements.

### Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting:
- **Incorporating into Incident Response**: Mature enterprises should include threat intelligence and threat hunting in their incident response processes.
- **Proactive Approach**: Helps in proactive identification of key attackers and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Improving Response**: Enables faster identification and remediation of threats.

### CIS Control 17 and Incident Response:
- **Relevance**: CIS Control 17 provides specific, high-priority steps for improving enterprise security.
- **Inclusion in Incident Response Plan**: These steps should be integrated into any comprehensive incident response plan.

### Additional Resource Recommendation:
- **CREST Cyber Security Incident Response Guide**: Provides guidance, standards, and knowledge on cyber defense topics. [Link to the guide](https://www.crest-approved.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CSIR-Procurement-Guide.pdf).

A comprehensive incident response plan, including training, threat intelligence, and adherence to security standards like CIS Control 17, is essential for effective incident management and mitigation.

# Safeguards

#### 17.1 Designate Personnel to Manage Incident Handling
- Designate one key person and at least one backup to manage incident handling.
- Responsibilities include coordinating and documenting incident response and recovery efforts.
- Personnel can be internal, third-party vendors, or a hybrid approach.
- If using a third-party vendor, designate at least one internal person to oversee their work.
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.

#### 17.2 Establish and Maintain Contact Information for Reporting Security Incidents
- Maintain contact information for parties to be informed of security incidents.
- Contacts may include internal staff, third-party vendors, law enforcement, cyber insurance providers, relevant government agencies, and Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) partners.
- Verify contacts annually to ensure information is up-to-date.

#### 17.3 Establish and Maintain an Enterprise Process for Reporting Incidents
- Establish and maintain an enterprise process for workforce to report security incidents.
- Process includes reporting timeframe, personnel to report to, reporting mechanism, and minimum information to be reported.
- Ensure process is publicly available to all workforce.
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.

#### 17.4 Establish and Maintain an Incident Response Process
- Establish and maintain an incident response process covering roles, responsibilities, compliance requirements, and a communication plan.
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.

#### 17.5 Assign Key Roles and Responsibilities
- Assign key roles and responsibilities for incident response, including legal, IT, information security, facilities, public relations, human resources, incident responders, and analysts.
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.

#### 17.6 Define Mechanisms for Communicating During Incident Response
- Determine primary and secondary communication mechanisms for reporting during a security incident (e.g., phone calls, emails, letters).
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.

#### 17.7 Conduct Routine Incident Response Exercises
- Plan and conduct routine incident response exercises for key personnel to prepare for real-world incidents.
- Exercises should test communication channels, decision-making, and workflows.
- Conduct testing annually, at a minimum.

#### 17.8 Conduct Post-Incident Reviews
- Conduct post-incident reviews to identify lessons learned and follow-up actions.
- Helps prevent incident recurrence.

#### 17.9 Establish and Maintain Security Incident Thresholds
- Establish and maintain security incident thresholds, differentiating between an incident and an event (e.g., abnormal activity, security vulnerability, data breach).
- Review annually or after significant enterprise changes.
