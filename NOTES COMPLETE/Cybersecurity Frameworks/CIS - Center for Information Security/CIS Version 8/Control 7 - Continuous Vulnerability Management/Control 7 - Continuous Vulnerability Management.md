# Overview

Develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities on all enterprise
assets within the enterprise’s infrastructure, in order to remediate, and minimize, the
window of opportunity for attackers. Monitor public and private industry sources for
new threat and vulnerability information.

# Why is this Control critical

### Managing Vulnerabilities and Timely Threat Information

- **Challenges for Cyber Defenders:**
  - Cyber defenders are constantly challenged by attackers who exploit vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to gain access.
  - Defenders must have timely threat information about software updates, patches, security advisories, and threat bulletins.
  - Regularly reviewing the environment to identify vulnerabilities before attackers do is crucial.

- **Continuous Vulnerability Management:**
  - Understanding and managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity that requires focus of time, attention, and resources.

- **Gap Between Vulnerability Discovery and Patching:**
  - Attackers often exploit vulnerabilities more quickly than an enterprise can remediate them.
  - Defenders can prioritize vulnerabilities based on impact to the enterprise or likelihood of exploitation due to ease of use.

- **Zero-Day Exploits:**
  - Attackers might use exploits for vulnerabilities not known within the security community, referred to as "zero-day" exploits.
  - Once the vulnerability is known, the patching process begins.

- **Vulnerabilities Known Within Closed Communities:**
  - Sometimes vulnerabilities are known within closed communities (e.g., vendor still developing a fix) for weeks, months, or years before being disclosed publicly.
  - Defenders must be aware that there might always be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate and therefore need to use other controls to mitigate.

- **Importance of Vulnerability Assessment:**
  - Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets compromised.

- **Challenges in Scaling Remediation:**
  - Defenders face challenges in scaling remediation across an entire enterprise and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities without impacting the enterprise’s business or mission.

# Procedures and tools

### Vulnerability Scanning and Management

- **Available Tools:**
  - A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of enterprise assets.
  - Some enterprises find commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances effective.

- **Standardization of Definitions:**
  - To standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities across an enterprise, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that map vulnerabilities to industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages such as CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and XCCDF, which are components of SCAP.

- **Frequency of Scanning:**
  - The frequency of scanning activities should increase as the diversity of an enterprise’s assets increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor.

- **Authenticated Scans:**
  - Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to authenticate into enterprise assets and perform more comprehensive assessments (authenticated scans).

- **Configuration Evaluation Tools:**
  - Various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations of enterprise assets, providing insight into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security weaknesses from administrators.

- **Integration with Problem-Ticketing Systems:**
  - Effective enterprises link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing systems to track and report progress on fixing vulnerabilities, highlighting unmitigated critical vulnerabilities to senior management.

- **Selection of Vulnerabilities to Fix:**
  - In selecting which vulnerabilities to fix or patches to apply, an enterprise should augment CVSS with data concerning the likelihood of a threat actor using a vulnerability or the potential impact of an exploit to the enterprise.

- **Trending Analysis:**
  - The most effective vulnerability scanning tools compare the results of the current scan with previous scans to determine how the vulnerabilities in the environment have changed over time, allowing security personnel to conduct vulnerability trending from month to month.

- **Quality Assurance Process:**
  - There should be a quality assurance process to verify configuration updates or that patches are implemented correctly and across all relevant enterprise assets.

# Safeguards

## 7.1 Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process

Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

## 7.2 Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process

Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews.

## 7.3 Perform Automated Operating System Patch Management 

Perform operating system updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.

## 7.4 Perform Automated Application Patch Management  

Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.

## 7.5 Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets

Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.

## 7.6 Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Externally-Exposed Enterprise Assets

Perform automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. Perform scans on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.

## 7.7 Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities Applications

Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis,based on the remediation process.
