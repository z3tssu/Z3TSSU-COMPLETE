# Overview

Prevent or control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious applications, code, or scripts on enterprise assets.
# Why is this Control critical### Malware Threats and Defenses

- **Nature of Malicious Software:**
  - Malicious software, such as viruses or Trojans, poses a significant threat on the internet. It can capture credentials, steal data, identify other targets within the network, and encrypt or destroy data. Modern malware variants leverage machine learning techniques, making them ever-evolving and adaptive.

- **Entry Points for Malware:**
  - Malware enters an enterprise through vulnerabilities within the enterprise on end-user devices, email attachments, webpages, cloud services, mobile devices, and removable media. It often relies on insecure end-user behavior, such as clicking links, opening attachments, installing software or profiles, or inserting USB flash drives.

- **Evolution of Malware:**
  - Modern malware is designed to avoid, deceive, or disable defenses, making it challenging to detect and mitigate.

- **Malware Defense Strategies:**
  - Malware defenses must operate in this dynamic environment through automation, timely and rapid updating, and integration with other processes like vulnerability management and incident response.
  - Defenses should be deployed at all possible entry points and enterprise assets to detect, prevent spread, or control the execution of malicious software or code.

# Procedures and tools
### Effective Malware Protection Strategies

- **Traditional Endpoint Malware Prevention and Detection Suites:**
  - Effective malware protection includes the use of traditional endpoint malware prevention and detection suites.

- **Automated Updates for Malware IOCs:**
  - Enterprises can receive automated updates from vendors to ensure that malware Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are up-to-date, enriching other vulnerability or threat data.

- **Central Management of Malware Tools:**
  - These tools are best managed centrally to provide consistency across the infrastructure.

- **Log Collection for Alerting and Incident Response:**
  - In addition to blocking or identifying malware, there is a focus on centrally collecting logs to support alerting, identification, and incident response.

- **"Living-off-the-Land" (LotL) Approach:**
  - Malicious actors are increasingly using a "living-off-the-land" approach to minimize the likelihood of being caught, which involves using tools or features that already exist in the target environment.

- **Enabling Logging:**
  - Enabling logging, as per the Safeguards in CIS Control 8, makes it significantly easier for the enterprise to follow events to understand what happened and why it happened.
