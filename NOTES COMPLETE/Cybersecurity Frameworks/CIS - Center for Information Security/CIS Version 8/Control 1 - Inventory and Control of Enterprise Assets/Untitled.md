# Safeguards

## 1.1 Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory

1. Asset Inventory 
	1. End-User Devices (Portable and Mobile)
	2. Network Devices
	3. Non Computing/IoT devices
	4. Servers
	5. Records Network Address (if Static or DHCP)
	6. Hardware Address
	7. Machine Name
	8. Enterprise Asset Owner
	9. Department for each asset
	10. Approval/Denial of Asset to network
2. Mobile Device Management 

## 1.2 Address Unauthorized Assets

- To address unauthorized assets on a weekly basis, an organization can implement the following process:

	1. **Detection**: Use network monitoring tools and security measures to detect unauthorized assets on the network. This can include devices that are not authorized to connect or devices that have been compromised.

	1. **Notification**: Notify the relevant security or IT team members about the presence of unauthorized assets.

	1. **Assessment**: Assess the risk posed by the unauthorized asset, including the potential impact on the network and data security.

	1. **Decision Making**: Based on the assessment, decide on the appropriate action to take. This could include removing the asset from the network, denying the asset from connecting remotely to the network, or quarantining the asset.

	1. **Action**: Implement the chosen action. For example, if the decision is to remove the asset from the network, disconnect the device from the network. If the decision is to quarantine the asset, isolate the device in a separate network segment.

	1. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the network to ensure that the unauthorized asset has been effectively addressed and that no further unauthorized assets are present.

- **Scenario:** An unauthorized device is detected on the network during the weekly audit.

	1. **Detection**: The network monitoring tool detects an unknown device connected to the network.

	1. **Notification**: The security team is notified about the unauthorized device.

	1. **Assessment**: The security team assesses the risk posed by the unauthorized device and determines that it could potentially compromise sensitive data on the network.

	1. **Decision Making**: The security team decides to quarantine the unauthorized device to prevent it from accessing sensitive data.

	1. **Action**: The security team configures the network to isolate the unauthorized device in a quarantine network segment, restricting its access to sensitive data.

	1. **Monitoring**: The security team monitors the network to ensure that the unauthorized device remains isolated and that no further unauthorized devices are detected.

## 1.3 Utilize an Active Discover Tool

> Utilize an active discovery tool to identify assets connected to the enterprise’s network. Configure the active discovery tool to execute daily, or more frequently.

1. **Utilize an Active Discovery Tool**: Implement an active discovery tool to identify assets connected to the enterprise's network.

2. **Configuration**: Configure the active discovery tool to execute daily, or more frequently, to ensure that any new or unauthorized assets are promptly identified.

3. **Detection**: The active discovery tool scans the network to identify all connected devices, including any unauthorized or new assets.

4. **Notification**: If the active discovery tool detects any unauthorized or new assets, it notifies the relevant security or IT team members.

5. **Assessment and Decision Making**: The security team assesses the risk posed by the unauthorized or new assets and decides on the appropriate action to take, such as removing the asset from the network, denying it from connecting remotely, or quarantining it.

6. **Action**: Implement the chosen action to address the unauthorized or new asset on the network.

7. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the network to ensure that the unauthorized or new asset has been effectively addressed and that no further unauthorized assets are present.

## 1.4 Use DHCP Logging to Update Enterprise Asset Discovery

> Use DHCP logging on all DHCP servers or Internet Protocol (IP) address management tools to update the enterprise’s asset inventory. Review and use logs to update the enterprise’s asset inventory weekly, or more frequently.

1. **Use DHCP Logging or IP Address Management Tools**: Enable DHCP logging on all DHCP servers or use IP address management tools to track IP address assignments and updates.

2. **Configuration**: Configure DHCP servers or IP address management tools to log all IP address assignments and updates.

3. **Logging and Review**: Regularly review DHCP logs or IP address management tool data to identify any changes in IP address assignments and update the enterprise's asset inventory accordingly.

4. **Update Asset Inventory**: Use the information from DHCP logs or IP address management tools to update the enterprise's asset inventory weekly, or more frequently, to ensure that it reflects the current state of assets connected to the network.

5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor DHCP logs or IP address management tool data to ensure that the asset inventory is kept up to date and accurate.

## 1.5 Use a Passive Asset Discovery Tool

> Use a passive discovery tool to identify assets connected to the enterprise’s network. Review and use scans to update the enterprise’s asset inventory at least weekly, or more frequently


1. **Utilize a Passive Discovery Tool**: Implement a passive discovery tool to monitor network traffic and identify assets connected to the enterprise's network.

2. **Configuration**: Configure the passive discovery tool to scan the network and collect information about connected assets.

3. **Scanning and Review**: Regularly review the scans conducted by the passive discovery tool to identify new or unauthorized assets.

4. **Update Asset Inventory**: Use the information from the passive discovery tool scans to update the enterprise's asset inventory at least weekly, or more frequently, to ensure that it reflects the current state of assets connected to the network.

5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the passive discovery tool scans to ensure that the asset inventory is kept up to date and accurate.
