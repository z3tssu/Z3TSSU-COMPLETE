# Overview 

Establish and maintain a security awareness program to influence behavior among
the workforce to be security conscious and properly skilled to reduce cybersecurity
risks to the enterprise.
# Why is this Control critical?

Here's a structured outline based on the provided information:

---

## Importance of User Actions in Security

### Critical Role of User Actions
- **Success or Failure**: User actions play a critical role in the success or failure of an enterprise's security program.
- **Attack Vector**: Users are often targeted by attackers to install malware through enticing links or email attachments.

### Causes of Incidents
- **Mishandling Sensitive Data**: Users can cause incidents by mishandling sensitive data.
- **Email Mistakes**: Sending sensitive data to the wrong recipient via email.
- **Loss of Devices**: Losing portable end-user devices.
- **Weak Passwords**: Using weak passwords or reusing passwords from public sites.

### Addressing Human Vulnerability
- **Fundamental Aspect**: No security program can effectively address cyber risk without addressing human vulnerability.
- **Different Risks for Different Users**: Users at every level of the enterprise have different risks based on their roles and access.

### Importance of Regular Training
- **Training Updates**: Training should be updated regularly to increase the culture of security and discourage risky workarounds.

## Effective Security Awareness Training Program

### Beyond Annual Training
- **Not Just Once-a-Year Video**: An effective program should not rely solely on a once-a-year training video.
- **More Frequent Messages**: Include more frequent, topical messages and notifications about security.

### Examples of Timely Messages
- **Strong Password Use**: Coincide messages with media reports of password dumps.
- **Phishing Awareness**: Highlight the rise of phishing during tax time or increased awareness of malicious package delivery emails during the holidays.

### Consideration of Regulatory and Threat Posture
- **Tailored Training**: Training should consider the enterprise's different regulatory requirements and threat posture.
- **Compliance-related Training**: For example, financial firms might focus on data handling and use, healthcare enterprises on handling healthcare data, and merchants on credit card data.

### Social Engineering Training
- **Awareness of Targeted Tactics**: Include awareness of tactics targeting different roles.
- **Examples**: Financial teams might receive Business Email Compromise (BEC) attempts posing as executives asking to wire money or emails from compromised partners asking to change bank account information.
