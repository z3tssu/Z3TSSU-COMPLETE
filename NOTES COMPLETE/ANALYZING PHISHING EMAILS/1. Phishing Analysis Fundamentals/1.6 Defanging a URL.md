# URL Defanger Tool

- Purpose: [The CyberChef Tool](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is designed to defang submitted URLs.
- Defanging Process: Defanging involves modifying potentially malicious links to make them unclickable, thereby reducing their potential danger. For example, it may replace "http" with "hxxp".
- Importance of Defanging URLs:
  - Mitigating Phishing: Defanging URLs helps protect against phishing attempts, as it reduces the likelihood of users inadvertently clicking on malicious links.
  - Enhanced Sharing Safety: Defanged URLs can be shared more safely, as they are less likely to be blocked by security systems that may flag potentially harmful links.
  - User Safety: By defanging URLs, users are prompted to actively copy and paste the link into their browser and manually modify it, such as changing "hxxp" back to "http". This encourages cautious behavior and reduces the chances of accidental clicks.
