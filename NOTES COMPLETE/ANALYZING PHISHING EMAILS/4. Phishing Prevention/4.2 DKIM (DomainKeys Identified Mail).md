# DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail and is used for authenticating emails. It is an open standard for email authentication, similar to SPF, and is essential for DMARC alignment. The advantage of DKIM is that it can survive forwarding, making it superior to SPF and a foundational component for securing email.

## DKIM Record Format

A DKIM record in the DNS follows this format:

```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxTQIC7vZAHHZ7WVv/5x/qH1RAgMQI+y6Xtsn73rWOgeBQjHKbmIEIlgrebyWWFCXjmzIP0NYJrGehenmPWK5bF/TRDstbM8uVQCUWpoRAHzuhIxPSYW6k/w2+HdCECF2gnGmmw1cT6nHjfCyKGsM0On0HDvxP8I5YQIIlzNigP32n1hVnQP+UuInj0wLIdOBIWkHdnFewzGK2+qjF2wmEjx+vqHDnxdUTay5DfTGaqgA9AKjgXNjLEbKlEWvy0tj7UzQRHd24a5+2x/R4Pc7PF/y6OxAwYBZnEPO0sJwio4uqL9CYZcvaHGCLOIMwQmNTPMKGC9nt3PSjujfHUBX3wIDAQAB
```

Here's an explanation of the record components:

- `v=DKIM1`: Optional version indicator for the DKIM record.
- `k=rsa`: Specifies the key type, with RSA being the default encryption algorithm.
- `p=`: Represents the public key, which is matched to the private key generated during the DKIM setup process.
