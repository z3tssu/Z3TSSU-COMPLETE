# Abusing SMTP for Command and Control (C2) Communications

## Introduction
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) has been exploited by adversaries as a means of establishing command and control (C2) channels. This technique allows them to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate email communication, making it difficult to detect and filter. Adversaries leverage application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to communicate and control compromised systems.

## Technique Overview
- Technique ID: T1071.003
- Technique Name: Application Layer Protocol: SMTP

## How Adversaries Exploit SMTP for C2 Communications
1. Adversaries use SMTP to send commands to compromised systems. These commands are embedded within the protocol traffic exchanged between the client and server.
2. The results of the executed commands are also embedded within the SMTP traffic.
3. By using SMTP, adversaries can avoid detection and network filtering as their traffic appears similar to legitimate email communication.

## Notable Groups Exploiting SMTP for C2
Several notable threat groups have employed this technique to establish C2 channels:

1. APT28 (Fancy Bear): A Russian-sponsored group known for cyber espionage activities. They have used SMTP for C2 communications to control compromised systems and exfiltrate data.
2. APT32 (OceanLotus): A Vietnamese-based threat group with a history of targeting organizations in Southeast Asia. They have utilized SMTP for C2 to maintain persistence and exfiltrate sensitive information.
3. Turla (Snake, Uroburos): A sophisticated Russian-speaking threat group involved in long-term espionage campaigns. They have employed SMTP as a covert channel for C2 communications.

## Mitigation Recommendations
To mitigate the abuse of SMTP for C2 communications, the following measures are recommended:

1. Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems: Implement network intrusion detection and prevention systems that utilize network signatures to identify traffic associated with specific adversary malware. This can help detect and mitigate malicious SMTP traffic at the network level.

## Detection Opportunities
To detect the exploitation of SMTP for C2 communications, organizations should consider the following:

1. Packet Analysis: Analyze the contents of network packets to identify application layer protocols that deviate from expected standards in terms of syntax, structure, or other variables. Look for SMTP traffic that does not conform to typical email communication patterns, as it may indicate malicious C2 activity.
